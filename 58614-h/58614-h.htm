<p class="center">Transcriber’s Notes</p>

<p>The cover was created by adding text to a plain background and is
placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation and spelling remain unchanged except where in conflict
with the index.</p>

<p>The ancient documents reproduced, particularly in Appendix IX, contain abbreviations represented by symbols no longer in use.
These have been represented by the tilde˜  .</p>

<p>Lower case Latin numbers surmounted by xx (a score) are shown thus iiij ∕ xx.</p>

<p>The two genealogical trees in volume 3 chapter 19 have been
supplemented with genealogical tables prepared by the transcriber.</p>

<small>THE RECORDS</small></h3>


<p>Before entering upon the government of London under the Plantagenet Kings,
let us first ask what are the documents in which we shall find information at first
hand.</p>

<p>No city in the world possesses a collection of archives so ancient and so
complete as the collection at the Guildhall. Riley, in his Introduction to the
<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, begins his list of those who have consulted the archives with
John Stow. Surely, however, the compiler of the <cite>Liber Albus</cite> itself, John
Carpenter, also consulted archives even in his day valuable and ancient. Strype,
in the preparation of his Edition of Stow, also consulted the City archives:—</p>

<p>“Again,” he says, “another Thing, that Labour and Diligence hath been
bestowed in, relates to the Laws, Customs and Usages of the City. Wherein
the Liberties and Privileges, as well as the Duties of the Citizens, are contained.
And therefore ought to be known by them, and in that regard necessary to be
set down, as accurately and largely as might be; being Things so material for
them to be advised of. This was laudably begun by A. M. in the last Edition:
but very much improved and enlarged in this. And to enable me the better in
the doing the same, it was not only necessary to gather up, and present the many
and most important Acts of Parliament and Common Council, relating to the
City and its Affairs; but also to have recourse to the authentick Books and Records
belonging to the Chamber of London: Where many ancient and curious Matters
of this nature might be found. But this seemed to be somewhat difficult to be
obtained. Yet by the Help of some friends of Quality and good Account, and
making the Court of Aldermen acquainted with my Design, and requesting their
Leave and Licence, I obtained an Order from them to Mr. Ashhurst, then Town
Clerk, to give me Access to some of their Books, that might be most to my
Purpose, and their Allowance to transcribe what I thought convenient out of
them: but withal I was enjoined by the Court to leave in Mr. Town Clerk’s hands
all my Notes that I should so collect thence, to be reviewed and examined; lest
some things published from them might seem prejudicial some way or other to the
City, or be judged not so convenient to be known; or lest any Mistakes might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
be made by me in transcribing. Which (as was fit), I readily complied with.
Many Remarks I took out thence, respecting both the ancient State of the City,
and also of the Courts, the Customs, the Magistrates, the Officers, &amp;c. The
Chief Books I conversed with, were those two famous ancient Volumes, the one
called <cite>Liber Horne</cite>, from the Writer, the other called <cite>Liber Albus</cite>, <i>i.e.</i> the White
Book. Both so often made use of and cited by Mr. Stow. This last mentioned
Book was composed in Latin, An. 1419. 7. H. 5. mense Novembris. And what it
contains is known by what is writ in one of the First Pages, viz. Continens tam
laudabiles Observantias, non scriptas, in dict. Civitate fieri solitas, quam notabilia
memoranda, &amp;c., sparsim et inordinate scripta. That is, ‘Containing as well
laudable Customs, not written, wont to be observed in the said City, as other
notable things worthy remembering, here and there scatteringly, not in any Order
written.’ The Compiler of this White Book was one Carpenter: whose Name
fairly and largely writ fronts the first page. Who I suppose may be that
J. Carpenter, sometime Town Clark in the Reign of Henry V., mentioned by
Stow in his Survey among the worthy Benefactors of the City: and whose Gifts
are there set down. In this Volume are inserted Memorials of the Maiors, Sheriffs,
Recorders, Chamberlains, and the other chief officers of the City: likewise all the
Charters granted by the several Kings of England from William the Conqueror:
and the Confirmations thereof. There is also a Tract of the Manner and Order,
‘How Barones &amp; Universitas Civitat. London, &amp;c. That is, the Barons (<i>i.e.</i>
the Freemen) and Commonality of the City of London, ought to behave and carry
themselves towards the King and his Justitiaries Itinerants in the Time it pleaseth
the King to hold Pleas of the Crown at the Tower of London: Together with
many other Matters and Subjects, contained in this Choice MS.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other Book, which I had also the favour of perusing, namely <cite>Horne</cite>,
was near an Hundred Years older, so named from Andrew Horne, sometime
Chamberlain of the City, viz. in the time of King Edward the Second. What
this Book contains, is told by this Inscription in one place of it, viz. ‘Iste
Liber restat Andreae Horne Piscenario London, de Breggestrete. In quo
continentur Cartae, &amp; aliae Consuetudines predict. Civitat. Angliae &amp; Statuta
per Henricum Regem, &amp; Edwardum Regem fil. predict. Regis Henrici edita.’
And again, ‘In isto Libro continentur tota Statuta, &amp; Ordinationes &amp; Cartae &amp;
Libertates, &amp; Consuetudines Civitat. London &amp; Ordo Justitiorum itinerantium
apud Turrim Lond. &amp; ipsum iter.’</p>

</div>

<p>Another Book also there was in the Chamber, which I also perused for the
same purpose, called <cite>Liber Custumarum</cite>. The First Tract whereof is, de
Laudibus Nobilitatis Insulae Britanniae. It is in old French, and consisteth of
thirteen chapters; Beginning thus—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>‘De Britaigne, que ore est appele Engleterre, &amp; qui est si benure sur toutes

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writer then applies himself to treat of London; as, the several Charters,
the Wards, and the Streets, Passages, and Places there, Privileges of Maiors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To which I add the <cite>Calendarium Cameræ</cite>, London, which was also another
Book in the Chamber, of use to me also in my searches.”</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century, except for Strype, the archives appear to have
been unmolested. Early last century Sir Francis Palgrave made many extracts
from this treasury. More recently, M. Auguste Thierry published certain treaties
of commerce of the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, between the citizens of
London and the merchants of Amiens. In 1843 M. Jules Delpit spent some
time at the Guildhall collecting from copies of documents relating to the connections
between France and England. Since then the work of publishing and annotating
these papers has gone on with great diligence.</p>

<p>A list of the items which comprise the City archives is given by Riley:—</p>

<p>“In addition to the early Registers, or Letter-Books, from A to K inclusive
(the respective dates of which are given at the conclusion of this volume), the
Record-room at Guildhall contains the following compilations:—<cite>Journals</cite> and
<cite>Repertories</cite> of the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1417 down
to the present time. <cite>Liber de Antiquis Legibus</cite>, a Latin Chronicle of the City
transactions from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1178 to 1274, the only one of the records hitherto published.
<cite>Liber Horn</cite>, a miscellaneous collection, date 1311, and compiled probably by its
original owner, Andrew Horn. <cite>Liber Custumarum</cite>, a compilation of a similar
nature, date about 1320, and put together probably under the supervision of the
same Andrew Horn. <cite>Liber Albus.</cite> <cite>Liber Dunthorn</cite>, a compilation in Latin,
Anglo-French, and English, prepared between <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1461 and 1490. <cite>Liber Legum</cite>,
a collection of laws from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1342 to 1590. <cite>Liber Ordinationum de Itinere</cite>,
compiled <cite>temp.</cite> Edward I.: in addition to which, there are the <cite>Assisa Panis</cite>,
commencing in 1284; <cite>Liber Memorandorum</cite>, date 1298, and several other
manuscript volumes of inferior note and value.</p>

<p>Among the books which are known to have formerly belonged to the
Corporation of London, but are now lost, are the following:—<cite>Liber Niger Major</cite>,
and <cite>Liber Niger Minor</cite>, both quoted in <cite>Liber Albus</cite>, <cite>Speculum</cite>, <cite>Recordatorium</cite>,
possibly identical with the <cite>Liber Regum Antiquorum</cite>, also lost; <cite>Magnus Liber
de Chartis et Libertatibus Civitatis</cite>; <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite>, and <cite>Liber de Heretochiis</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
both mentioned in the Letter-Books, according to M. Delpit, as formerly in
existence. It is not improbable that these volumes may have disappeared on
the disastrous occasion when, in the reign of Edward VI., the Lord Protector
Somerset borrowed three <cite>cartloads</cite> of books from the Library at Guildhall, none
of which were ever returned.”—Riley’s Introduction to <cite>Liber Albus</cite>.</p>

<p>Since this list was prepared, the Corporation have undertaken the publication
of Riley’s <cite>Memorials of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Centuries</cite>;
Sharpe’s <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>; the <cite>Calendar of Letters</cite>; Sharpe’s <cite>London and the
Kingdom</cite>; Price’s <cite>Descriptive Account of the Guildhall</cite>; Agas’s “Map of London”;
Riley’s <cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>. In addition to these volumes, one must not
omit Arnold’s <cite>Chronicle of Customs</cite>, published in 1811; the publications of the
Camden Society, which include many documents invaluable to the student of
City history; other Chronicles translation has made accessible, such as the “Dialogue
de Scaccario,” published in full in Stubbs’s <cite>Select Charters</cite>.</p>

<p>The text of the first is that of Stubbs’s <cite>Select Charters</cite>; that of the second is
taken from the transcript in the <cite>Liber Custumarum</cite> (collated with the <cite>Liber Rubeus</cite>).</p>

<p>One very curious mistake was discovered by Round in the first. In clause 9
the word <em>wardemotum</em> is used. This, by comparison with the corresponding clause
in the second Henry’s Charter, should be <em>vadimonia</em>: in other words, both Charters
confirmed to the citizens “the property mortgaged to them and the debts due to
them.”</p>

<p>To consider the differences:—</p>

<p>(1) No citizens are to plead without the walls. The second Charter adds
“except in pleas for exterior tenures, my moneyers and servants excepted.”</p>

<p>By the second clause the citizens are freed from Scot and Lot and Danegeld
and Murder. Henry the Second substitutes acquittance of murder within the
City and Portsoken.</p>

<p>(6) Clause 6 is omitted in the second Charter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>(9) Clause 9. I have already shown the error discovered by Round in the
word <em>wardemotum</em>.</p>

<p>(10) Here is a limitation, “quæ infra urbem sunt,” which are within the City.</p>

<p>(11) The clause concerning debtors omitted in the second Charter.</p>

<p>(12) About taking toll or any other custom from the citizens: for the “citizens”
is substituted the Sheriff.</p>

<p>(13) Observe that Henry the Second does not speak of the Sheriff of London,
but of <em>my</em> Sheriff.</p>

<p>The most important omission, however, in the second Charter is that which
gives the citizens the right to hold Middlesex on the <em>firma</em> of £300 a year, and the
right to elect their own Justiciar and Sheriff.</p>

<small>THE COMMUNE</small></h3>


<p>We are now in a position to proceed to the establishment of the Commune. The
stages of any important reform are, first, the right understanding of the facts;
then a tentative discussion of the facts; then an animated discussion of the facts;
next, an angry denial of the facts; then a refusal to consider the question of reform
at all; finally, the unwilling acceptance of reform with gloomy prophecies of disaster
and ruin. One knows nothing about these preliminary stages as regards the great
Civic Revolution of 1191. But I am quite sure that, just as it was with the Reform
Bill of 1832, so it was with the creation of a Mayor in 1191. There were no
newspapers, no pamphlets, and no means of united action except the Folk Mote at
Paul’s Cross—which would clearly be of no use on such a point—and the casual
meeting day by day of the merchants by the riverside. There was no Royal
Exchange; there were no Companies’ Halls for them to meet in; we have no
record of any meeting; but we may be sure that the inconvenience of the situation
was discussed whenever two or three were gathered together. We may be equally
sure that there were Conservatives, those who loved the old days, and dreaded the
power of a central authority. Opinion as regards reform has always been divided,
and always will be divided; there are always those who would rather endure the ills
that exist than meet unknown ills which may be brought upon them by change.
I do not know how long the discussions continued and the discontent was endured.
On this subject history is dumb. One or two points, however, are certain. The
first is that all the great towns of Western Europe were eager for the Commune;
the next is the model which they proposed to copy.</p>

<p>It must have been well known to our Kings throughout the twelfth century
that the creation of the Commune in the great trading cities of Western Europe was
not only ardently desired by the citizens, but had been actually achieved by many.
What they desired was a Corporation, a municipality, self-government within their
own walls. It is certain that London looked with eyes of envy upon Rouen, a City
with which it was closely connected by ties of relationship, as well as those of trade,
because Rouen obtained her Commune fifteen years before London obtained the
mere shadow of one. It was, in fact, from Normandy that the City derived her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
desire to possess a Commune. The connection between London and Rouen was
much closer than we are generally willing to recognise. Communication was easy,
the Channel could be crossed whenever the wind was favourable, the Englishman
was on a friendly soil when he landed in Normandy, a country ruled by his own
Prince. The Normans found themselves also among a friendly people on the soil
of England. They came over in great numbers, especially to London. The
merchants of Rouen had their port at Dowgate from the days of Edward the
Confessor. Many of the leading London merchants came from Rouen and Caen.
Therefore, whatever went on in Rouen was known in London. Now, in the year
1145, great and startling news arrived. It was heard that the City of Rouen had
obtained a Commune, that is to say, a municipality, with a Mayor for a central
authority, and powers of government over the whole City. Further news came that
the Commune was established in other parts of France and in the Netherlands, and
that everywhere the cities were forming themselves into municipalities, breaking
away from the old traditions and organising themselves. This was not done
without considerable opposition. The rights of the Church, the rights of the
Barons, the rights of the King, were all invaded by the creation of the Commune.
It was, however, a great popular movement, irresistible. It succeeded for a time,
but in one city after another it fell to pieces. In England it succeeded greatly,
and it continued to extend and to flourish. Meanwhile the merchants of London
understood very well that, in this respect, what suited the people of Rouen would
suit them. Indeed, the conditions were very similar in the two Cities.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Then began a serious agitation—but not after the modern fashion—among the
London citizens in favour of the new civic organisation. Henry the Second would
have none of it. In his jealousy of any transfer of power to the people, he allowed
no guilds to be formed save with his consent; at one blow he suppressed eighteen
“Adulterine” guilds which had thus been created. But he could not suppress the
ardent desire of the people for the Commune.</p>

<p>Had the successor of Henry been as wise a King and as clear-sighted as his
father, the desire of the City might have been staved off for another generation.
But Richard was not Henry. When he was gone upon his crusade, the government
was left in the hands of his Chancellor, William Longchamp. And then follows one
of those episodes in which the history of London becomes actually the history of the
whole country.</p>

<p>Longchamp had become unpopular with all classes. The barons felt the
power of his hand and resented it; the merchants found themselves continually
subject to extortionate fines, the clergy to exactions. He held all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Royal Castles; he was attended by a guard of a thousand horsemen; he affected
the parade of royalty. In considering this personage, it must be remembered that
he had many enemies in all ranks, and that his character has been chiefly drawn by
his enemies. It was, of course, a great point against him—and always hurled in his
teeth—that he was of humble origin; he was also, as a matter of course, charged
with every kind of immorality. His haughtiness, which might be excused in his
position of Viceroy, was undoubted; it was called by his enemies insolence; and
there could be no doubt as to the taxes which he imposed. In the letter written
by Hugh, Bishop of Coventry, after Longchamp’s deposition, even ecclesiastical
invective seems to have done its very worst. The real reason of the deadly hatred
is summed up in the following:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To omit other matters, he and his revellers had so exhausted the whole kingdom, that they did not
leave a man his belt, a woman her necklace, a nobleman his ring, or anything of value even to a Jew. He
had likewise so utterly emptied the King’s treasury, that in all the coffers and bags therein, nothing but
the keys could be met with, after the lapse of these last two years.” (<cite>Roger de Hoveden</cite>, Riley’s trans., vol.
ii. p. 235.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption">OBVERSE AND ORIGINAL REVERSE OF THE SEAL OF THE CITY OF LONDON, SHOWING FIGURE OF ST. THOMAS À BECKET<br />
From a wax cast in the Guildhall Museum.</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, Peter of Blois replied to the gentle Bishop of Coventry
with a letter which must have awakened in the mind of that prelate something of
the ungovernable wrath which belonged to his time. He says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> “The Bishop of
Ely [Longchamp], one beloved by God and men, a man amiable, wise, generous,
kind, and meek, bounteous and liberal to the highest degree, had by the dispensations
of the Divine favour, and in accordance with the requirements of his own
manners and merits, been honoured with the administration of the State, and had
thus gained the supreme authority. With feelings of anger you beheld this, and
forthwith he became the object of your envy. Accordingly, your envy conceived
vexation and brought forth iniquity; whereas he, walking in the simplicity of his
mind, received you into the hallowed precincts of his acquaintanceship, and with
singleness of heart, and into the bonds of friendship and strict alliance. His entire
spirit reposed upon you, and all your thoughts unto him were for evil.” (<cite>Roger de
Hoveden</cite>, Riley’s trans., vol. ii. p. 238.)</p>

<p>We have not to determine the guilt or the innocence of the Chancellor; it is
enough to learn that there were opposite views.</p>

<p>The Barons and Bishops were headed by John, Earl of Mortain,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> brother of
the King.</p>

<p>It was notorious that of all those who went out to fight the Saracen, few
returned. Richard, in the Holy Land, was not sparing himself; it was therefore
quite likely that he would meet his death upon the battlefield. Then, as the heir to
the crown was a child, and as a man, and not a child, was wanted on the throne,
John had certainly every reason to believe that his own accession would be
welcomed. He prepared the way, therefore, by joining the popular cause, and put
himself at the head of the malcontents.</p>

<p>And now, at last, the citizens saw their chance. They offered to use the whole
power of the City for John and the barons, but on conditions. J. H. Round, in his
<cite>Origin of the Mayoralty of London</cite>, p. 3, says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was at about the same time that the ‘Commune’ and its ‘Maire’ were triumphantly reaching
Dijon in one direction, and Bordeaux in another, that they took a northern flight and descended upon
London. Not for the first time in her history, the Crown’s difficulty was London’s opportunity, and when
in October, 1191, the administration found itself paralysed by the conflict between the King’s brother John,
and the King’s representative, the famous Longchamp, London, finding that she held the scales, promptly
named the concession of a ‘Commune’ as the price of her support. The chroniclers of the day enable us
to picture to ourselves the scene, as the excited citizens who had poured forth overnight, with lanterns and
torches, to welcome John to the capital, streamed together on the morning, of the eventful 8th October,
at the well-known summons of the great bell, swinging out from its campanile in St. Paul’s Churchyard.
There they heard John take the oath to the ‘Commune,’ like a French King or Lord, and then London
for the first time had a municipality of her own. What the English and territorial organisation could never
have brought about, the foreign Commune, with its commercial basis, could and did accomplish.</p>

<p>And as London alone had her ‘Commune,’ so London alone had her Mayor. The ‘Maire’ was
unquestionably imported with the ‘Commune,’ although it is not till the spring of 1193 that the Mayor of
London is first mentioned. But already in 1194 we find a citizen accused of boasting that ‘come what
may the Londoners shall never have any King but their Mayor.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Not for the first time.” Remember that in 1066, after the battle of Hastings,
London only admitted William as King on conditions. London elected Henry the
First King on conditions. London made Stephen King on conditions. London
received the Empress on conditions; a week later the Queen also on conditions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and now, once more, London saw its chance—such a chance as might never occur
again—for getting what it wanted—on conditions.</p>

<p>Let us, however, enter more fully into the details of this victory, and into the
causes which led to concession.</p>

<p>Longchamp gave the barons an opening by his attempted exclusion of Geoffrey,
Archbishop of York (natural brother of the King), from the kingdom, and his
forcible seizure of the Archbishop from the very horns of the Altar. Geoffrey
complained to John, who gave orders that the
Chancellor should stand his trial for the injury he
had done to the Archbishop. Remembering the
position of Longchamp, as the actual representative
of the King, this summons was in the nature of an
ultimatum. As regards the City, Longchamp had
alienated many of the citizens by his exactions and
by the great works which he carried on at the
Tower, a point on which the citizens were always
extremely jealous.</p>

<div class="caption">OLD MAYORALTY SEAL, 13TH CENTURY<br />From a wax cast in Guildhall Museum.</div>
</div>

<p>A day was named for the hearing of the case.
The Court, or the Council, sat at Reading. There
were present: John, Earl of Mortain; the Archbishop
of York as plaintiff; the Archbishop of Rouen—his appearance is most significant,
with the bishops and the principal barons of the realm.</p>

<p>But no Chancellor appeared, nor did any message or reply come from him.</p>

<p>The Court being broken up, the barons marched from Reading to Windsor,
while the Chancellor retired from Windsor to the Tower of London.</p>

<p>On the day following, the barons marched from Windsor into London. By
this statement we may clearly understand that everything had already been
arranged with the citizens, otherwise the gates would have been shut. The barons,
with their following, were admitted into the City; they held another meeting at the
Chapter House of St. Paul’s; and here John, the Archbishops of York and Rouen,
and nearly all the bishops and barons of the realm, received the principal citizens,
and solemnly granted to the City of London its long-sought Commune, and swore
to maintain it firmly so long as it should please the King.</p>

<p>The words of Roger of Hoveden are quite clear; it is extraordinary that there
could be any doubt about what was done:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“On the same day, also, the Earl of Mortaigne, the Archbishop of Rouen, and the other justiciaries
of the King, granted to the citizens of London the privilege of their commonalty; and, during the same
year, the Earl of Mortaigne, the Archbishop of Rouen, and the other justiciaries of the King, made oath
that they would solemnly and inviolably observe the said privilege, so long as the same should please their
lord the King. The citizens of London also made oath that they would faithfully serve their lord King
Richard, and his heirs, and would, if he should die without issue, receive Earl John, the brother of King
Richard, as their King and Lord.” (<cite>Roger de Hoveden</cite>, Riley’s trans., vol. ii. p. 230.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This done, they proceeded without any trouble to depose the Chancellor, who
fled, and, after many adventures, got across to Normandy in safety.</p>

<p>Observe the very great importance attached to this step. It was the condition
in return for which London joined the barons in getting rid of a rapacious Viceroy;
the concession was not lightly, but solemnly, granted, as a measure of the greatest
weight, in presence of the chief persons of the kingdom; all present set their hands
to the Act; all present swore to maintain it.</p>

<p>One of the chroniclers, Richard of Devizes, a very strong Conservative,
shows us what was thought of the step by his party:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On that very day,” he says, “was granted and instituted the Commune of the Londoners, and the
magnates of the whole realm, even the Bishops of the province itself, were compelled to swear to it.
London learned now for the first time, in obtaining the Commune, that the realm had no King, for neither
Richard nor his father Henry would ever have allowed this to be done, even for a million marks of silver.
How great those evils are which spring from a Commune may be understood from the common saying that
it puffs up the people and it terrifies the King.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Ralph de Diceto says more succinctly, “All the before-mentioned <em>magnates</em>
[<i>i.e.</i> John, the archbishop, the bishops, earls, and barons] swore [that they would
maintain] the <em>Commune</em> of London.” It is he who tells us what the others do not
tell us, that this parliament was holden in the Chapter House of Saint Paul, London.</p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis says:—</p>

<p>“In crastino vero convocatis in unum civibus, communione, vel ut Latine minus
vulgariter magis loquamur, commune seu communia eis concessa et communiter
jurata.”</p>

<p>It is therefore abundantly plain that the citizens desired, and obtained from
John, the concession of the Commune.</p>

<p>Another chronicler informs us that the Commune was granted to the whole
body of citizens gathered together. This means that it was announced at a Folk
Mote specially summoned at Paul’s Cross. I cannot but think that the importance
of the concession called for the assemblage of the whole people. Mr. Round must
be right in his picture. After the meeting in the Chapter House, the Great Bell
of St. Paul’s was rung; the people flocked together; the bishop stood up at Paul’s
Cross and told them the great news: that they had at last won their community;
that for the first time they were one City; that they had for the first time their
leader and their speaker.</p>

<p>The City got its Commune. The first Mayor, Henry FitzAylwin, or Henry of
London Stone, was elected. Two years afterwards, he is spoken of as the Mayor of
London. He held the office for five-and-twenty years: it was twenty-four years
after his election that he was recognised by the King. John’s recognition, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
he was no more than Earl of Mortain, heir to the Crown, was not official. As we
have heard already, Richard never recognised either the Commune or the Mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. H. C. Coote, in a paper published by the London and Middlesex Archæological
Society, argues that so great a change as that from the former to the later
constitution demanded a Charter; that therefore this Charter must have been
granted; and that it must have been lost. It is sufficient to note the fact that there
is no such Charter. Considering the circumstances, it does not seem as if a Charter
could have been granted. The Commune was conferred so long as it should please
the King. It did not please the King, who never recognised the Commune.
Therefore, one would infer there was no Charter.</p>

<p>In 1215 the citizens obtained from John their right to elect their own Mayor.</p>

<p>As for the meaning of the Commune, Stubbs says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The establishment of the ‘Communa’ of the citizens of London which is recorded by the
historians to have been specially confirmed by the Barons and Justiciar on the occasion of Longchamp’s
deposition from the Justiciarship is a matter of some difficulty as the word ‘Communa’ is not found in
English town-charters, and no formal record of the act of confirmation is now preserved. Interpreted,
however, by foreign usage and by the later meaning of the word ‘Communitas’ it must be understood to
signify a corporate identity of the municipality which it may have claimed before and which may even have
been occasionally recognised but was now firmly established: a sort of consolidation into a single organised
body of the variety of franchises, guilds, and other departments of local jurisdiction. It was probably
connected with, and perhaps implied by, the nomination of a <em>Mayor</em> who now appears for the first time.
It cannot, however, be defined with certainty.” (Stubbs’s <cite>Select Charters</cite>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Round<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> points out that the words “concessa est communæ Londinensium,”
agree exactly with the granting of the French Communes. The same words
were used for the Communes of Senlis, of Compiègne, of Abbeville, and of Poitiers.
The Commune again, in France, did not necessarily imply the election of a Mayor.
At Beauvais and Compiègne at first there was no Mayor.</p>

<p>Round next shows, which is very remarkable, that the long struggle of the
citizens to hold the City and County at the <em>firma</em> of £300, which the Crown persistently
strove to raise to £500 and more, was terminated in 1191, the year
when the Commune was granted, by a return to the old sum of £300. This is
a very important fact. Entries of the years 1192 and 1197 show that this yearly
sum was maintained at the lower figure. Three points, therefore, are certain:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. A Commune was granted to London in 1191.</p>

<p>2. The Firma of City and County was simultaneously lowered from over
£500 to the old sum of £300.</p>

<p>3. The Mayor of London first appears in 1193.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is at this point that an almost contemporary document, discovered by
Mr. Round, in the British Museum, which is nothing less than the oath of the
Commune, throws a flood of light on the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i lang="la">“Sacramentum commune tempore regis Ricardi quando detentus erat Alemaniam (sic).</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Compare this oath with that of a freeman of the present day:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I solemnly declare that I will be good and true to our Sovereign Lord King Edward, that I will be
obedient to the Mayor of this City, that I will maintain the franchises and customs thereof, and will keep
this City harmless in that which in me is; that I will also keep the King’s peace in my own person, that I
will know no gatherings nor conspiracies made against the King’s peace, but I will warn the Mayor thereof
or hinder it to my power; and that all these points and articles I will well and truly keep according to the
laws and customs of this City to my power.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, to quote from Round:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the first time we learn that the government of the City was then in the hands of a Mayor and
<i lang="fr">échevins</i> (<i>skevini</i>). Of these latter officers no one, hitherto, had even suspected the existence. Dr. Gross,
indeed, the chief specialist on English municipal institutions, appears to consider these officers a purely
continental institution. But in this document the Mayor and <i lang="fr">échevins</i> do not exhaust the governing body.
Of Aldermen, indeed, we hear nothing; but we read of ‘alii probi homines’ as associated with the Mayor
and <i lang="fr">échevins</i>. For these we may turn to another document, fortunately preserved in this volume, which
shows us a body of ‘twenty-four’ connected with the government of London some twelve years later
(1205-6).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i lang="la">Sacramentum xxiiij<sup>or</sup> factum anno regni regis Johannis vij<sup>o</sup>.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Quod legaliter intendent ad consulendum secundum suam consuetudinem juri domini regis quod ad

<p>“Of a body of twenty-<em>four</em> councillors, nothing has hitherto been known. To a body of twenty-<em>five</em>
there is this one reference (<cite>Liber de Antiq. Leg.</cite> Camden Soc. p. 2):</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Hoc anno fuerunt xxv electi de discretioribus civitatis, et jurati pro consulendo civitatem una cum Maiore.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The year is Mich. 1200-Mich. 1201; but the authority is not first-rate. Standing alone as it does, the
passage has been much discussed. The latest exposition is that of Dr. Sharpe, Records Clerk to the City
Corporation (<cite>London and the Kingdom</cite>, i. 72):</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Soon after John’s accession we find what appears to be the first mention of a court of Aldermen as a
deliberate body. In the year 1200, writes Thedmar (himself an Alderman), ‘were chosen five-and-twenty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the more discreet men of the City and sworn to take counsel on behalf of the City, together with the Mayor.
Just as, in the constitution of the realm, the House of Lords can claim a greater antiquity than the House of
Commons, so in the City—described by Lord Coke as <i lang="la">epitome totius regni</i>—the establishment of a Court of
Aldermen preceded that of a Common Council.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>But they could not have been Aldermen of the wards, simply because the
number do not agree.</p>

<p>To find out who they were, we must turn to the foreign evidence. At Rouen
the advisers of the Mayor were a body of twenty-four annually elected.</p>

<p>This oath on election was as follows. It will be seen how closely it resembles
that of the English Commune—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“(II). De centum vero paribus eligentur viginti quatuor, assensu centum parium, qui singulis annis
removebuntur: quorum duodecim eschevini vocabuntur, et alii duodecim consultores. Isti viginti quatuor, in
principio sui anni, jurabunt se servaturos jura sancte ecclesie et fidelitatem domini regis atque justiciam quod et
ipse recte judicabunt secundum suam conscienciam, etc.</p>

<p>LIV. Iterum, major et eschevini et pares, in principio sui eschevinatus, jurabunt eque judicare, nec pro
inimicitia nec pro amicitia injuste judicabunt. Iterum, jurabunt se nullos denarios nec premia capturos, quod
et eque judicabunt secundum suam conscienciam.</p>

<p>LV. Si aliquis juratorum possit comperi accepisse premium pro aliqua questione de qua aliquis trahatur in
eschevinagio, domus ejus ... prosternatur, nec amplius ille qui super hoc deliraverit, nec ipse, nec heres ejus
dominatum in communia habebit.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The three salient features in common are (1) the oath to administer justice fairly; (2) the special provisions
against bribery; (3) the expulsion of any member of the body convicted of receiving a bribe.</p>

<p>If we had only ‘the oath of the Commune,’ we might have remained in doubt as to the nature of
the administrative body; but we can now assert, on continental analogy, that its twenty-four members
comprised twelve ‘skevini’ and an equal number of councillors. We can also assert that it administered
justice, even though this has been unsuspected, and may, indeed, at first arouse question.” (Round, p. 240.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We conclude, therefore, from continental analogy, that the twenty-four of
London comprised twelve “skevini” and an equal number of Councillors. What
became of this Council?</p>

<p>Round is of opinion, in which most will agree, that this Council was the germ
of the Common Council, and he points out that the oath of a member of the
Common Council, like that of the ancient Council of twenty-four, still binds him—(1)
not to be influenced by private favour; (2) not to leave the Council without
the Mayor’s permission; (3) to keep the proceedings secret.</p>

<p>Now the oath of an Alderman (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, Riley’s translation, p. 267)
is quite different. It is the oath of a Magistrate and superintendent of a ward—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You shall swear, that well and lawfully you shall serve our lord the King in the City of London,
in the office of Alderman in the Ward of N, wherein you are chosen Alderman, and shall lawfully treat and
inform the people of the same Ward of such things as unto them pertain to do, for keeping the City, and
for maintaining the peace within the City; and that the laws, usages, and franchises of the said City you
shall keep and maintain, within town and without, according to your wit and power. And that attentive
you shall be to save and maintain the rights of orphans, according to the laws and usages of the said City.
And that ready you shall be, and readily shall come, at the summons and warning of the Mayor and
ministers of the said City, for the time being, to speed the Assizes, Pleas, and judgments of the Hustings,
and other needs of the said City, if you be not hindered by the needs of our lord the King, or by other
reasonable cause; and that good lawful counsel you shall give for such things as touch the common profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
in the same City. And that you shall sell no manner of victuals by retail; that is to say, bread, ale, wine,
fish, or flesh, by you, your apprentices, hired persons, servants, or by any other; nor profit shall you take
of any such manner of victuals sold during your office. And that well and lawfully you shall (behave)
yourself in the said office, and in other things touching the City.—So God you help, and the saints.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, for English evidence. The City of Winchester shows also the
existence of a Council of twenty-four, which continued until 1835:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Il iert en la vile mere eleu par commun assentement des vint et quatre jures et de la commune ...
le quel mere soit remuable de an en an.... Derechef en la cite deinent estre vint et quatre jurez esluz
des plus prudeshommes e des plus sages de la ville e leaument eider e conseiller le avandit mere a franchise
sauver et sustener.” (Round, p. 242.)</p>

<p>“There shall be in the City a Mayor elected by common consent of the twenty-four ‘Jurats’
and the Commune.... The which Mayor is to be removeable from year to year. Further, in the City
there must be twenty-four ‘Jurats’ elected from the most notable and the wisest of the City, both loyally
to aid and to counsel the aforesaid Mayor to protect and to maintain the franchise.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At Winchester the twenty-four retained their distinct position, and it was
not till the sixteenth century that the Aldermen were interposed between the
Mayor and the Council.</p>

<p>Thus did London get the recognition of its Commune—its community,—and
with it the Mayor. There was certainly reason for the suspicion and hostility
of the old-fashioned Conservatives towards the new constitution. Some of the
citizens, we are told, in the first exuberant joy over their newly-acquired liberties
thought that henceforth there would be no need of a King at all. They pictured
to themselves a sovereign State like that of Genoa, Pisa, or Venice, in which the
City should be independent and separate from the rest of the country. I dare
say there were such dreamers. Three years later, in 1194, we hear of citizens
who boasted that “come what may, the Londoners shall never have any King but
their Mayor.” Fortunately, the Mayor himself observed wiser counsels.</p>

<p>And now we may ask what it was that the City got with its new form of
government. The Mayor took over the whole control of trade, which had been
in the hands of the mysterious Guild Merchant; but with this vast difference,
that he was provided with powers to enforce his ordinances. He took over, in
addition, the administration of justice, the maintenance of order in the City,
the subjection of all the various Courts and Ward Motes under one Central Court,
with its Magistrates, its Bailiffs, its Officers, and its Servants. London as a
corporate body actually began in 1191. The Sheriffs lost a great part of their
importance; the Aldermen became, but not immediately, Magistrates of the City
and not of the Wards only; the citizens themselves began to elect their representatives
to rule the City; the regulations of the various crafts passed under
the licensing authority of a Judge and his Assessors, who enforced their commands
by penalties. In a word, the Commune abolished the ancient treatment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
City as an aggregate of private properties, each of which had its own Lord of
the Manor, or Alderman, and substituted one great City, presided over by a
representative possessed of power and authority, and backed by the strong arm
of the law.</p>

<div class="caption">KING JOHN SIGNING MAGNA CHARTA<br />

</div>

<p>The step, in fact, made the future development of London possible and
natural. Wherever there is self-government there is the power of adjusting
laws and customs to meet changed conditions. Where there is no self-government
there is no such power. A long succession of the wisest and most benevolent
Kings would never have done for London what London was thus enabled to do
for herself, because, to use the familiar illustration, it is only the foot which knows
where the shoe pinches.</p>

<p>We must not claim for the wisdom of our ancestors that London advanced
at once, and by a single step, to the full recognition of the possibilities before her.
I admit that there were many failures; we know that there were jealousies and
animosities; that there were times when the Mayor was unable to cope with
the difficulties of the situation—for example, when Edward the First suppressed
the Mayoralty altogether, and for eleven years ruled the City strongly and
wisely,—but we can claim for the City that there was continuous and steady
advance in the direction of orderly and just administration, and that the unity
of the City, thus recognised and conceded, became a most powerful factor in the
extension and expansion of the City and its trade.</p>

<p>To return to the changes made possible. The chief officer of the City was
called a Mayor, after French custom; the Mayor was not appointed by the King;
he was elected by the citizens from their own body; his powers were at first
indefinite and uncertain; thus, the first act of Edward the Third, a hundred
years later, was to make the Mayor one of the Judges of Oyer and Terminer
for the trials of criminals in Newgate; the citizens’ right of electing the Mayor
was always grudgingly conceded and continually violated. I suppose, next, that
the practice of electing the Aldermen, which came in gradually, was accelerated
by the natural desire of the citizens to elect all their officers. Another cause
was undoubtedly the fact that the manors, or wards, of the City did not
continue in the hands of the original families. The holders parted with their
property; perhaps they retained certain manorial rights, which were afterwards
bought out. The wards in which this happened began to elect their Aldermen;
by the year 1290 there were only four wards still named after the Lords of the
Manor. And it seems reasonable that, as soon as the City had a recognised head
and chief under the King, he would be considered first, so that the Bishop’s
Aldermanry naturally fell into abeyance. Certainly we find no more Charters
addressed to the Bishop. The first Mayor remained Mayor for twenty-five
years; that is to say, for life. It is natural to suppose that he was at first put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
forward on occasion as the City’s spokesman, as well as its chief officer. It is not
absolutely certain that the Mayor was first appointed in 1191, when John granted
the “Commune.” In some French towns the Mayor, as we have seen, came
after the Commune, but he is mentioned in 1193. In 1194 Richard’s Charter
makes no mention of the Mayor; he existed, certainly, but he was not yet
acknowledged. In 1215—May 8th—John conceded the citizens the privilege of
electing their Mayor.</p>

<p>This concession to London was followed by the same concession to other
cities and towns of England. The Commune or municipality of London became
the model for all other municipalities granted to other towns. It is also the model
for all municipalities created wherever our race settles itself, and wherever an
English-speaking town is founded. This fact makes the history we have just
considered of the most vital interest and importance to every citizen or burgess
in whatever town is governed by Mayor, Aldermen, and the Court of Common
Council.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than sum up these notes on the changes effected by the
Commune with another quotation from Dean Stubbs:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Communa of London, and of those other English towns which in the twelfth century aimed at
such a constitution, was the old English guild in a new French garb; it was the ancient association, but
directed to the attainment of municipal rather than mercantile privileges; like the French communa, it
was united and sustained by the oaths of its members and of those whom it could compel to support it.
The mayor and the jurati, the mayor and jurats, were the framework of the communa, as the aldermen
and brethren constituted the guild, and the reeve and good-men the magistracy of the township. And the
system which resulted from the combination of these elements, the history of which lies outside our present
period and scope, testifies to their existence in a continued life of their own. London, and the municipal
system generally, has in the mayor a relic of the communal idea, in the alderman the representative of the
guild, and in the councillors of the wards, the successors to the rights of the most ancient township system.
The jurati of the Commune, the brethren of the guild, the reeve of the ward, have either disappeared
altogether, or taken forms in which they can scarcely be identified.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We have spoken of the first Mayor of London, and what we know about him
has been summed up by Round for the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>. We
do not know his parentage. It has been conjectured that he was the grandson of
Leofstan, Portreeve of London before the Conquest. But there were three or four
Leofstans. It is suggested by Stubbs that he was descended from Ailwin Child,
who founded or endowed Bermondsey Abbey in 1082. It is also suggested that
he was an hereditary Baron of London. In the “Pipe Roll” of 1165, a Henry
FitzAylwin, Fitz Leofstan, with Alan his brother, pay for succeeding to land
in Essex or Hertfordshire. Now FitzAylwin the Mayor did hold land in
Hertfordshire by tenure of serjeantry. The name appears in four documents as
Henry Fitz Ailwin, or Æthelwine, before he was Mayor, and in many documents
after he was Mayor. In the former name the latest date is 30th November 1191,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and under the latter the first is April 1193. It would therefore seem as if the
Mayoralty was not established at first on the concession of the grant. It may
well be that it took time for the citizens to assume their full organisation. We
may fairly assume that his office, if not his election, dates from the day of that
concession.</p>

<p>FitzAylwin was one of the Treasurers for the King’s ransom in 1194. He
was also called Henry of London Stone, because his house stood on the north
side of Candlewick Street, near St. Swithin’s Church, over against London Stone.
He presided over a meeting of citizens on 24th July 1212, and died a few weeks
later. He left children from whom many persons can still trace descent. Among
them, as the two living representatives of the first Mayor, are, I believe, Lady
Beaumont and the Earl of Abingdon. Fifty years ago a learned antiquary,
Stapleton, drew up a list of all the descendants of Henry FitzAylwin.</p>

<p>King Richard took no hostile proceedings against the Mayoralty. He never
recognised it; but he never tried to abolish it, and as the enemies of the Commune
observed that nothing disloyal to the King, nothing dangerous to the Church,
was set up in the City, they learned to regard the institution without disfavour
or suspicion, so that when the Mayoralty was at last recognised by King John,
there was no longer any hostility, or even any misgiving. The old order had
passed, giving way to the new. How necessary this new order was; how it fitted
in with the old order, so that there was revolution without dislocation, is proved
by its adoption in all our towns and cities, by its long continuance, and by its
present vitality.</p>

<small>THE WARDS</small></h3>


<p>The large area included by the Roman Wall was parcelled out, after the Saxon
occupation, into manors, socs, or estates, held by private persons. Some of them
passed into the possession of the Church; some into possession of the City; some
changed hands. That these manors included the most densely populated parts of
the City, or Thames Street, and the streets north of that main artery, proves that
the first allotment took place very early in the Saxon occupation, when the City was
still deserted; this fact, indeed, affords another proof of that desertion, because we
cannot believe that a populous quarter, covered with warehouses and merchants’
residences, should have been assigned to one man or to a dozen men. The value
of the manor, comprising gardens lying among ruined foundations, shut off from the
river and its fish by a high and thick stone wall, could have been no more than
that of a manor lying beside the north wall, on which corn was growing and
orchards were planted. Just as the Bedford Estate in London began with the
fields of Bloomsbury; just as the Westminster Estate began with the marshes
round Thorney Island, so the original manors of London, at first gardens and
wastes, became built over or sold for building purposes. What, then, were
manorial rights? Let us read the instructions of Archdeacon Hall on this point.
He says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Manorial property was a possession differing in many respects from what is now called landed
estate. It was not a breadth of land, which the lord might cultivate or not as he pleased, suffer it to be
inhabited, or reduce it to solitude and waste; but it was a dominion or empire, within which the lord was
the superior over subjects of different ranks, his power over them not being absolute, but limited by law
and custom. The lord of a manor, who had received by grant from the crown, saca and soca, tol and
team, was not merely a proprietor, but a prince; and his courts were not only courts of law, but frequently
of criminal justice. The demesne, the assised, and the waste lands were his; but the usufruct of the
assised land belonged, on conditions, to the tenants, and the waste lands were not so entirely his, that
he could exclude the tenants from the use of them. It was this double capacity, in which the lord stood,
to his tenants, as the arbiter of their rights, as well as the owner of the land, which rendered it necessary
to the due discharge of the duty of his station, that the lord of a manor should be such a person as Fleta
describes: Truthful in his words, faithful in his actions, a lover of justice and of God, a hater of fraud and
wrong, since it most concerns him not to act with violence, or according to his own will, but to follow
advice, not being guided by some young hanger-on, some jester or flatterer, but by the opinion of persons
learned in the law, men faithful and honest, and of much experience. Manors were petty royalties; the
court and household of the lord resembling in some degree that of the King. In Fleta an account is
given of the officers of the royal household, the Senescallus Hospitii Regis, who held his court in the
palace; the Marescallus, the Camerarius, the Clericus panetarii; but in the latter part of the book, which
treats of the management of manors, we find the lord of the manor attended by the Senescallus, who
held his courts, by the Marescallus, who had the charge of his stud, and by the Coquus, who rendered
an account of the daily expenditure to the Senescallus.”</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Some of these manors belonged to the Bishop or to a Church or to a religious
foundation, but the rights and the government and the management of all were
alike. Again to quote Archdeacon Hall:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Manors, whether royal and baronial, or episcopal and ecclesiastical, were to their owners sources
of wealth, derived from two distinct sources—the exercise of a legal jurisdiction and the rent of cultivation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of land. The Ecclesiastical Manors differed in no respect from those which were in lay hands. They
were the sources of income, not the field of spiritual labour. They contributed to the support of the
Bishop or of the Chapter, and of the religious household of the Cathedral, by profits and revenues no
way different from those derived by the Sovereign and the Lords from other Manors. It is remarkable
that neither the Exchequer Domesday, nor the Domesday of St. Paul’s contains any evidence, that the
Ecclesiastical Manors had any superior religious privileges, or were the centres from which religious
knowledge was diffused to the neighbourhood. The Manors of the religious houses were in reality
secular possessions; and their history, as shown in the Domesday of St. Paul’s, is valuable as illustrating
the social, rather than the religious, condition of the time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be noted, however, that none of the City manors were royal; nor did
any of their manors at any time belong to any noble great or small. The nobles
had their town houses, many of them large and stately palaces covering a broad
area, but they were never Lords of any London Manor. And the Church property
in the City included, after a time, only the site of the various religious foundations
and the house property which they happened to possess. The Ward of Portsoken,
of which mention has already been made, is the only exception to this rule.</p>

<p>The manors, then, became the wards of the City.</p>

<p>The earliest list of the wards is contained in a document found among the
archives of St. Paul’s, entitled: “The measurements of the land of St. Paul’s
within the City of London.” The date is early in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The list is not, unfortunately, complete; nor can all the wards be identified.
But it is most valuable for what it does contain. A facsimile is published in J. E.
Price’s <cite>Guildhall</cite>. Thus, the first ward is “Warda Episcopi,” the Bishop’s Ward,
Cornhill. Then we have <i>Warda Haco</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of St. Nicholas of Acon, in Lombard
Street; <i>Warda Alwold</i> (Cripplegate); <i>Warda Fori</i>—of the Market-place—Chepe;
<i>Warda Ralph, son of Algod</i>; <i>Warda Osbert Dringepinne</i>; <i>Warda Hugh, son of
Ulgar</i>; <i>Warda Brocesgange</i>; <i>Warda Liured</i>; <i>Warda Reimund</i>; <i>Warda Herbert</i>;
<i>Warda Edward, son of Wizel</i>; <i>Warda Sperling</i>; <i>Warda Brichmar the Moneyer</i>;
<i>Warda Brichmar the Cottager</i>; <i>Warda Godwin, son of Esgar</i>; <i>Warda Alegate</i>;
<i>Warda Rolf, son of Liviva</i>; <i>Warda Algar Manningestepsunne</i>; <i>Warda Edward
Parole</i>.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>There are twenty wards in all. It will be observed that they are all named
after single persons except the Ward of the Market Place and the Ward of Alegate.
These single persons were the proprietors, the barons, the owners of the land; the
wards were the private manors into which the City was divided. (See Appendix I.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>It is impossible to say how many wards there were in the whole City. The
owners were barons of right, a rank which afterwards descended to their successors,
the elected Aldermen. The first governing body of London consisted of the
owners of these estates, to whom were added the more important merchants. In
the changes and chances of fortune, the estates changed hands; families died out
and were replaced; we find, in the fourteenth century, for instance, that all the old
families, whose names we know, had by that time disappeared, left the City, or
become merged in the general population. But the manors themselves seem to
have remained for the most part unbroken. It is difficult even at the present day
to cut up a manor. The Lord of the Manor, called the Alderman, formed part of
the ruling body by virtue of possession. In other words, the government of
London, despite the survival of the Folk Mote, was a territorial aristocracy. In
the <cite>Liber Albus</cite> (p. 30), Carpenter calls attention to the fact that although in his
day—the beginning of the fifteenth century—the wards were known by their own
names, they had formerly borne the names of their Aldermen. Thus, he says that
the Ward of Candelwyk Street was formerly the Ward of Thomas Basyng; the
Ward of Castle Baynard was the Ward of Simon Hadestok; Tower Ward was the
Ward of Henry le Frowyk; Vintry Ward was the Ward of Henry le Covyntre;
Farringdon Ward Without was the Ward of Anketill de Auvern. So also, as
W. J. Loftie points out, the Ward of the Bridge was at one time that of John Horn;
the Cordwainers’ Ward was that of Henry le Waleys; Langbourne Ward that of
Nicolas de Winton; Aldgate that of John of Northampton; Walbrook of John Adrian;
Broad Street of William Bukerel; Aldersgate of Wolman de Essex; Bread Street of
William de Denham. Not one of these names can be found in the list just quoted.</p>

<p>By the time of Carpenter, the wards were clearly defined. Up to the reign of
Edward the First their boundaries were unsettled.</p>

<p>The Ward Mote has been held from time immemorial, according to Stow.
That is to say, whenever a manor became settled and populated, it was the interest
of the Alderman to have a court of Assistants who could act as his Police, his
Constables, his Detectives.</p>

<p>At what period the Aldermen ceased to be hereditary and were elected by the
citizens, I know not. The election of Aldermen is not contemplated in the Charters
of Henry the First, Henry the Second, Richard the First, or John. In the second
Charter of Henry the Third, the Barons (<i>i.e.</i> Aldermen) of the City are appointed
to elect the Mayor. In the Charter of Edward the Second it is provided that the
Aldermen shall be “removable yearly and be removed on the day of St. Gregory
(the 12th of March) and in the year following shall not be re-elected, but others
shall be elected in their stead.” (<cite>Liber Albus.</cite>)</p>

<p>In the year 1354 the old order was restored, and the Aldermen remained in
office for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>The following is a list of the twenty-four wards into which London was divided
before the end of the thirteenth century, with the names of the respective
Aldermen:—</p>

<p>In this list we observe that Cheap Ward is still called Ward Fori; Langbourne
Ward appears as Langeford; Broad Street Ward is Lodyngebery; Farringdon is
Ludgate and Newgate Ward; Aldgate is Alegate. Forty years later there is
found another list of wards in which the modern names appear with the exception
of Alegate which is written Algate. The names of the wards are in four cases
derived from the trades carried on in them: in four cases from the chief families
in them: in the rest from buildings or monuments belonging to them. The names
of the Aldermen show sixteen belonging to the old ruling families: seven belonging
to new families or to trades, and one, the Prior of Holy Trinity, as an official
Alderman.</p>

<p>The date of this list of wards and Aldermen is probably somewhere about 1290,
nearly two hundred years after the first list. We have, then, the old City families
still represented among the Aldermen. Were they elected? It is impossible to
say how long the hereditary system was maintained, and when it was replaced by
the elective system. The revolution was a peaceful and bloodless one, since there
is no record of it. William Farringdon, who bought his ward, and his son Nicholas,
were successive Aldermen of the ward for no less than eighty-two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>The change of the names in the wards seems to have been carried out between
the year 1272, when Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite> begin, and 1314, when a list of wards
appears with the names that belong to the street or quarter.</p>

<p>From this list, it appears that between 1272 and 1283, of fourteen wards named
in the <cite>Memorials</cite>, three only have the name of their street or quarter, the rest being
all named after their Aldermen. But from 1283 to 1314 there are nineteen wards
mentioned, and they are all named after their street or district. It is therefore safe
to conclude that within these forty years the aldermanry had ceased to be proprietary
or hereditary. We may connect this fact with the story of Walter Hervey’s
election in 1272 (see <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a>), which proves that the oligarchy had already lost much
of their power.</p>

<p>To repeat. The City consisted originally of a certain number of manors or
private estates: the proprietors of these estates were the so-called barons of the
City: some of the estates remained in the hands of their proprietors for many
generations: these proprietors constituted themselves, without any law other than
immemorial custom, the ruling council of the City. The boundaries of the manors
remained after the property had been cut up and divided among many proprietors.
Perhaps the Aldermen remained with the representative of the old family. When,
one by one, the original proprietors had disappeared, died out, or parted with their
property, the ancient boundaries of the ward were retained, and the inhabitants
elected a chief, whom they still called Alderman, in place of the hereditary Alderman.
It was ordered, in the thirteenth century, that the Alderman, like the Mayor, should be
elected every year, and should go out after serving his year of office. But, as the
new method was found to make difficulties, after half a century they went back to
the old plan of electing an Alderman for life, and so the custom has remained ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
since. The Alderman of the ward represents the Lord of the Manor, and is its
principal magistrate for life.</p>

<p>Attention has been directed to the “Warda Episcopi.” Was, then, the Bishop
of London formerly an Alderman? He was. He took his seat among the Aldermen
in right of the property of the Church. He did not, therefore, take part in the
temporal government of the City as Bishop, but as Alderman. This right he
delegated to a Provost. So, also, the Prior of the Holy Trinity was an Alderman,
not as Prior, but as Lord of the Manor of Portsoken.</p>

<p>When the Bishop ceased to preside over a ward I know not. It is certain,
however, that it was of incalculable advantage at that time for the City of London
to be partly governed in its temporal affairs by one who was a great churchman, a
great lord, a person often with the King, a scholar and a statesman, one who had
nothing to gain by encroaching on the liberties of the people, and, therefore, one who
might be trusted. In certain cases it is known that he acted not by his Provost, but
personally. It was no doubt the Bishop who persuaded the citizens into admitting
William into the City as King on conditions which involved no dishonour, but quite
the contrary—namely, that nothing was to be changed, but that all the rights and
liberties which the citizens had enjoyed under Edward the Confessor, or Alfred
himself, should be continued.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that parish boundaries and ward boundaries are by
no means the same. One instance there is where a parish and a ward are conterminous,
it is that of St. Michael Bassishaw.</p>

<p>Maitland gives the list of the wards in 1393 with their rateable value at one
fifteenth. Thus:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Wards in the West of Wallbrook.</p>

<p>The Ward of Cheap, taxed in London at £72: 16s. and in the Exchequer accounted for £72.</p>

<p>The Ward of Coleman-Street, taxed in London at £19 and in the Exchequer accounted for £19.</p>

<p>The Wards on the east side of Wallbrook.</p>

<p>The Ward of Candlewick-Street, taxed in London at £16 and in the Exchequer accounted for £16.”</p>

<p>
(Maitland, vol. i. p. 181.)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Outside the wards and not belonging to them, or within their jurisdiction, were
certain socs, liberties, or vacant spaces. Such were the Precinct of St. Paul’s, the
Precincts of the Religious Houses, the Sanctuary of St. Martin’s le Grand, and the
“Roomlands” or open spaces of West Chepe, East Chepe, Tower Hill, and other
places which were afterwards absorbed into the wards.</p>

<p>The names of those who owned the manors, together with the names found in
contemporary documents, sufficiently prove how the Norman kings kept their
promise and left the London merchants in possession of their property and their
land. For with a few exceptions they are all Saxon names. The first, Mayor,
Henry of London Stone, was FitzAylwin: Basing, Batt, Rokesby, Durman,
Pountney, Bukerel, Billing, Faringdon, Thetmar, Orgar, Leofwin, Brechmar,
Alwold, Algod, Esgar, Algar, Liured are all Saxon. Becket, it is true, is a name
from Caen in Normandy. Blunt is Blond; Anketill de Auverne proclaims his origin.</p>

<p>We remark also that lads from the country had already begun to seek their
fortune in London. We find Henry de Covyntre, Wolmar de Essex, John de
Northampton, and many others.</p>

<p>We are considering in this place the City only. But we cannot avoid connecting
the land all round the City, especially the land of Middlesex, held in farm by the
citizens, with the City itself.</p>

<p>The City was surrounded by a broad belt of manors. These were very largely
held by the Bishop, the cathedral, and certain abbeys and religious houses: in
addition to these proprietors there were also a few nobles and private persons. The
Abbey of Westminster owned a great estate, including the Strand and the lands
between the river and Oxford Street: the De Veres held the manor of Kensington,
but passed it over to the Abbey of Abingdon. The Chapter of St. Paul’s possessed
manors at Willesden, Brondesbury, Brownswood, Chamberlain Wood, Mapesbury,
Marden, Harlesden, Twyford, St. Pancras, Rugmere (St. Giles’s), Tottenhall,
Kentish Town, Islington, Newington, Holborn, Portpool (Gray’s Inn), Finsbury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Hoxton, Wincock, Barn, Mora, and Fald Street; “covering a belt of land extending
from St. Pancras on the west to the episcopal Manor of Stepney on the east.”</p>

<p>This being the case, the question arises as to the advantages accruing to the
City in obtaining the Farm of Middlesex at £300 a year. It is certain that they
would not have welcomed the privilege so eagerly but for the advantages it
offered. These advantages may be summed up by the simple fact that the
King’s rights over Middlesex were farmed out to the City. To begin with, the
shire could no longer remain, as Southwark continued to be, a refuge or safe
asylum for criminals whom it was difficult to catch, and still more difficult, in the
conflict of royal and manorial rights, to bring to justice: next, it was a great step,
though not at first understood, to creating the unity of the City. Other advantages
in the grant are set forth by Archdeacon Hall:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Sheriffs of Middlesex—every London burgher, that is—henceforth found themselves in
possession, so to speak, when disputes arose between king and people; there was also a certain income
from the courts which may eventually have been greater than the rent; the military protection of the City
was rendered more easy when its civil jurisdiction extended so far beyond the walls, and the right conceded
to the citizens to hunt in the surrounding forests formed the outward symbol of the completeness
of their rule—a symbol which signified more under a Norman king than at any time since. To recognise
the customs and laws of the City itself; to allow the ancient assemblies, the husting and the folkmote;
to sanction the election of magistrates by the still unincorporated burghers; all these things were of importance,
but the grant of Middlesex was more than any of them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been said that these manors made the growth of the suburbs impossible.
But not in all directions. There was no obstacle to the growth of the riverside
suburb called the Strand; here a long line of stately houses displaced the fishermen
from Blackfriars to Westminster stairs: there was no obstacle to the extension of
London along the river to the east, yet it did not extend in that direction. How
the Church, which was the principal owner of the suburban manors, affected the
successive settlements is described by Archdeacon Hall:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“The suburbs, as I have said, owe their present condition not so much to the City as to the Church.
By the time Henry I. made his grant of the county to the City, the broad lands of Middlesex had, almost
wholly, passed into the possession of the great ecclesiastical foundations. What St. Paul had left, St.
Peter acquired; and St. Martin, St. Bartholomew, and a little later, Holy Trinity at Aldgate, were
watching to pick up fragments that the others had overlooked. Therefore, we must ascribe the modern
suburbs, with their curious anomalies of local government, the so-called ‘metropolitan area’ with its
imaginary boundaries, its districts and precincts, its boards and its vestries, answering to the sokes and
liberties, the sanctuaries and wards within the walls, more to the clergy than to the municipality. The
City supplied the population to colonise the wastes and woods; but the Church supplied the houses
for them to dwell in, marked out their streets, and controlled the direction of each fresh stream of
emigrants. When the first settlers along Holborn, or in Norton, or by the White Chapel, went forth from
the City gates, it might have been expected that the rulers who had sway within the walls, and to whom
Middlesex now belonged, as much as it had belonged to Earl Leofwine in the good days of King Edward,
would have guided their steps and continued to govern their actions. But, where the citizens formed
‘wards without’ the walls, it was only by the leave, or in spite of the prohibition, of the Church. The
King, when he gave to London the jurisdiction he had exercised in Middlesex, could give no land with it.
At the time of the Survey, the royal estates had passed already to the Church, and William hardly owned
an acre in the county. The estates of the Norman nobles had nearly all gone into the same hands by the
time of Henry’s accession; and an enumeration of the Middlesex manors which never, at any time, were
held ‘in mortmain’ would not comprise half-a-dozen names. The citizens could not protect their public
meeting-place, their parade-ground, their markets within the walls, from the grasp of the ‘dead hand’;
much less could they protect the new colonies of citizens in Kensington or Chelsea, in Hackney or
Tyburn, far out in the open country.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE FACTIONS OF THE CITY</small></h3>


<p>The long struggle between the oligarchic and the popular party, which was carried
on without cessation for at least two hundred years, was at its acutest and its worst
in the thirteenth century. It must be noted here because it exercised great
influence in the development of municipal institutions. To this point I will return
after we have considered the leading features of the faction struggle complicated
by the machinations of the King.</p>

<p>We must note, at the outset, that the various Charters conferring and confirming
old and new rights did not lay down laws for the government of the City;
nor was it contemplated that the City was to be governed by the craftsmen. By
Saxon custom every man was a lord or a dependant upon a lord; yet there was a
Folk Mote: by Norman rule every townsman was under an over-lord and every
countryman was under the Lord of the Manor; yet the Folk Mote was continued.
That the craftsmen of the town were to be the rulers of the town; that they were
to have a voice, as we understand it, in the management of the City was considered
by the “Barons” of the City, the Aldermen, the wealthy merchants and the
notables as a thing to be resisted in every way possible. Yet, to repeat, there was
the Folk Mote with the lingering memory of a time when the people were
summoned and shouted their approval or their refusal.</p>

<p>Again, we have been accustomed for so long to consider London as one of the
greatest and most important cities of the world that we fail to realise her position in
the twelfth or thirteenth century, as compared with certain other cities of Western
Europe, long since sunk into decay and insignificance.</p>

<p>At that time the cities of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, now so shrunken and so
deserted, were, in point of population, at least twice as great as London, while their
trade and wealth were very much greater, even in proportion, and the liberties
enjoyed by their citizens were such as London did not dream of until fired by their
example. The trade between the Port of London and these towns, especially
Bruges, made the citizens acquainted with these liberties as well as this wealth. It
is difficult not to connect the newly-born ambitions and aspirations of the craftsmen
of London with the liberties acquired by those of the Flemish towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>London was governed, as we have seen, by the owners of the land; they were
presently joined by the richer merchants; but they remained few in number. And
they ruled the City in their own interests. We have seen how valuable was the
Charter of Henry the First, how it assisted the City to advance, how it enabled the
merchants to conduct their trade with greater security and ease, how it gave the
citizens the right of electing their own sheriffs and their own justiciar, who were to
be appointed by the citizens. What this meant, I take it, was that the Aldermen
nominated the sheriffs, and their election by the people took the form of an assent
declared at a noisy and tumultuous Folk Mote. It certainly could not be, and was
not, an election by the citizens as we understand it. That the governing body
had the power of election was a concession of the highest importance to them.
The privileges of freedom from toll, etc., were again of enormous value to the
merchants, but only indirectly to the craftsmen; now craftsmen understand direct
advantage only. In a word, the Charters did not interfere with the government of
the City, which remained in the hands of the small company of Aldermen. The
Charters were intended to advance the trade and the prosperity of the City, not to
confer new liberties upon the working man. Yet the craftsman began to understand
the possibilities open to him.</p>

<p>The struggle begins, so far as history knows of it, with the brief and stormy
episode of William Longbeard, shortly before the granting of the Commune. His
is the first articulate voice heard among the murmurs of popular discontent.
Perhaps there were other Hampdens before him whose dust lies beneath our feet,
and whose blood like his tinged the earth of Smithfield, but we do not know
of them.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the twelfth century change was impending. Guilds there
were. As yet, they were not, as a rule, trading, but religious societies. As we
have seen, in 1186, Henry the Second fined as many as eighteen for having
been incorporated without license. What can this indicate but that the regulation
of trade was contemplated by these guilds as well as the charitable and religious
objects for which such associations were at first founded?</p>

<p>Even more important than the regulations of trade is the great fact that by
means of their guilds the people, who had hitherto been inarticulate and powerless,
were now becoming able to speak and to listen and to act.</p>

<p>Their grievances seem to have been at first founded rather on suspicion than
on proof. When the City was taxed, the assessors were the Aldermen; the craftsmen
had to pay what they were ordered to pay; no one knew what the Aldermen
themselves paid. They were therefore, very naturally, accused of shifting the
whole burden of taxation from their own shoulders to those of the craftsmen. But a
grievance of suspicion, among a rude and ignorant people, is as dangerous as a
grievance founded on fact. Another grievance was the poll tax, in which the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
men paid as much as the rich men. And a standard grievance in every industrial
city, and in every age, is the question of wages and hours.</p>

<p>Presently the Deliverer arose—who yet was to prove no Deliverer.</p>

<p>William, called FitzOsbert, and sometimes William Longbeard, was the
grandson of a certain Osbert, one of the Aldermen who, in 1125, had given to the
Priory of the Holy Trinity, with the King’s permission, the lands belonging to the
Cnihten Guild.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, by birth one of the governing class, whose abuses he
attacked. He was also, it would seem from the first episode in his life which has
come down to us, of a nature easily moved and imaginative, and, like his grandfather,
disposed to piety. Such a mind belongs to the man who instinctively hates
injustice and oppression.</p>

<p>Most of the chroniclers who tell the story belong to the other side, and,
therefore, charge him with everything that they dare: the crimes, however, are so
vague, such as obscurity of origin, meanness of appearance, ingratitude to a brother,
that they mean nothing and may be neglected. I prefer to take the evidence of the
historian, Roger de Hoveden, who says as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The rich men, sparing their own purses, wanted the poor to pay everything. But a certain lawyer,
William FitzOsbert by name, or Long-beard, becoming sensible of this, being inflamed by zeal for justice
and equity, became the champion of the poor, it being his wish that every person, both rich as well as
poor, should give according to his property and means for all the necessities of the State; and, going
across the sea to the King, he demanded his protection for himself and the people.” (Roger de
Hoveden’s <cite>Annals</cite>, vol. ii.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The facts are few as they have come down to us. But we can learn something
about the man. He was, to begin with, a visionary; now it is out of visionaries
that martyrs, confessors, and enthusiasts are made. I know that he was a visionary
from a little story related of him. He was one of those who took the cross and the
vow when King Richard went on his crusade, and sailed in the fleet which contained
the London and the Dartmouth Crusaders whose intention was to fight the
Infidels. This fact points in the direction of an emotional temperament easily
moved to enthusiasm. The fleet was becalmed in the Bay of Biscay. Thereupon,
William FitzOsbert, with one Geoffrey, a goldsmith, prayed to St. Thomas à
Becket—the newly canonised saint—already considered as the natural protector of
London. St. Thomas, to the eyes of faith, answered their prayers in person. He
appeared to them. He bade them be of good cheer; he promised a favourable
breeze in the morning, after which they should accomplish their vows and return in
safety. It must have been a visionary who would actually see the saint and
receive his message. In the morning the promised breeze sprang up; the ships
proceeded on their course and put in at a Portuguese port. Here they learned
that the King of Portugal was in dire straits, being besieged by the Moors with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
vast army. The Crusaders resolved upon going to his assistance; among them
marched William FitzOsbert, rejoicing in the promise made him by St. Thomas à
Becket, that he should perform his vows and should return. In these days he
would have said that St. Thomas had need of him in his native town.</p>

<p>The Moors being defeated, the London Crusaders thought they had done
their duty in fighting the Infidel, and so returned home.</p>

<p>After this crusade, William made the discovery above described. Now he was
not of obscure birth, because he belonged to one of the great City families; his
grandfather had been an Alderman, probably his father as well; he was a scholar—one
Chronicler calls him a lawyer; he was a man of eloquence; he could persuade
and carry with him the rude craftsmen of London, whom he gathered together at
Paul’s Cross in the name of the old Folk Mote. He found out irregularities
of all kinds on the part of the governing class. When there was neither audit
nor scrutiny, irregularities were inevitable. He imparted these discoveries to
the King, who listened with attention, and doubtless communicated his views
on the subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury, then justiciary. It may be
understood, also, that his communications rendered him peculiarly hateful to his
own class, the governing body, whom he had deserted. His nickname, Longbeard,
denotes his desertion of that class, which affected Norman customs, and either wore
no beard or a very small beard. He himself went back to the old Saxon custom,
which seems to have been retained by the craftsmen, and grew a long beard.</p>

<p>He left, then, his own people; he was no longer one of the governing class;
he joined the party of the craftsmen; to show his change of opinion and of plan,
he grew a beard. And we find him a great orator, haranguing the people on
their wrongs; calling them together at Paul’s Cross; followed by a crowd who
waited on his words; going to the King with proofs of the evil-doing of the
Aldermen; getting, at first, the ear of the King, until Richard was set against
the reforms by reports against FitzOsbert, such as that he was continually
exciting the populace to further discontent. The historians, as has been stated,
differ as to William’s real character. Stow, copying some of the Chronicles,
says that he was “poor in degree, evil-favoured in shape ... a counterfeit
friend to the poor ... a man of evil life, a murderer ... who falsely accused
his elder brother of treason....”</p>

<p>Holinshed says that he was a “seditious person and of a busie nature.”
Fabyan’s account is much more favourable. I subjoin his account of the whole
episode:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“And Wyllyam with ye longe berde shewyd to ye kynge the owtrage of the ryche men, whiche, as
he sayd, sparyd theyr owne, and pylled the poore people. It is sayde that this Wyllyam was borne
in London, and purchased that name by use of his berde. He was sharpe of wyt, and somedeale
lettred, a bolde man of speche, and sadde of his contenance, and toke upon hym gretter dedys than he
cowde weld: and some he usyd cruell, as apereth in appechynge of his owne brother of treason, ye
whiche was a burges of London, and to hym had shewed great kyndenesse in his youthe. This Wyllyam
styred and excyted ye common people to desyre and love fredam and lybertye, &amp; blamed the excesse
and owtrage of ryche men: by syche meanys, he drewe to hym many great companyes, and, with all
his power, defendyd the poore mannys cause agayne the ryche, and accused dyuerse to ye kyng, shewinge
that by theyr meanys, ye kyng loste many forfaytes and encheatis. For this, gentylmen and men of
honoure, malygned agayne hym, but he had suche comforte of ye kyng, that he kept on his purpose.
Then ye kyng beyng warned of the congregacions that this Wyllyam made, commaunded hym to cease
of such doyngys, that the people myght exercyse theyr artis and occupacions; by reason whereof it was
lefte for a whyle: but it was not longe or ye people followed hym, as they before hys tyme had done.
Then he made unto them colacions or exortacions, &amp; toke for his anteteme, ‘Haurietis aquas in
gaudio de fontibus saluatoris,’ that is to meane, ye shall drawe, in joy, waters of ye wellys, of our savyour:
and to this he added, ‘I am,’ sayd he, ‘ye savyoure of poore men; ye be poore and have assayed ye
harde handis of ryche men; now drawe ye therefore holefull water of lore of my wellys, and that with
joy, for ye tyme of youre vysytacyon is comyn. I shall,’ sayde he, ‘departe waters from waters. By
waters I understande the people; then shall I departe the people which is good and meke, from the
people that is wyckyd and prowde, and I shall dissevyr the good and the ylle, as the lyght is departyd
from the derkenesse.’ When the bysshop was brought to ye archebisshop of Canterbury, he, by
counceyll of the lordis of the spyritualtye, sent unto this Wyllyam, commaundynge hym to appere before
the lordis of the kyngys counceyll to answere unto suche maters as there shulde be layed unto hym. At
which day this Wyllyam appered, havynge with hym a multytude of people, in so moch that the lordys
were of hym adrad, for ye which cause they remyttyd hym with pleasaunt wordys for that tyme, and
commaundyd certeyn personys, in secrete maner, to espye when he were voyde of his company, and
then to take hym, and to put hym in sure kepyng, the which, accordyng to that commaundment, at tyme
convenyent, as they thought, sette upon hym and to have takyn hym; but he, with an axe, resysted
them, and slew one of theym, and after fled to Saynt Mary Bowe Church, of Chepe, and tooke that for
his savegarde, defendynge hym by strength, and not by ye suffragis of ye church: for to hym drewe,
shortly, great multytude of people; but in short processe, by mean of the hedys and rulers of ye cytie,
the people mynysshed, so that, in short tyme, he was left with fewe personys, and after, by fyre,
compellyd to forsake the church, and so was taken, but not without shedying of blode. After which
takyng, he was arreygned before ye jugys, and there, with ix. of his adherentis, cast and judged to dye,
and was hanged, and they with hym the day folowynge. But yet the rumor ceased not; for the common
people reysyed a great cryme upon the archbisshop of Cantorbury, and other, and sayd that, by theyr
meanes, Wyllyam, which was an innocent of suche crymes as were objecte and pute agayne hym, and
was a defendor of the pore people agayne extorcioners and wronge doers, was by them put wrongfully
to deth: approuyng hym an holy man and martyr, by this tale folowyng: sayinge, that a man, beyng seke
of the fevers, was curid by vertue of a cheyn which this Wyllyam was bounde with in tyme of his dures
of enprysonement, which, by a preest of the allye of the sayd Wyllyam was openly declared &amp; prechyd,
wherby he brought the people in such an errour, that they gave credence to his wordys, and secretly,
in the night, conveyed away ye jebet that he was hangyd upon and scrapyd awey that blode made there
an holow place by fetchyng away of that erthe, and sayde that syke men and women were cured of
dyverse sykenesses by vertue of that blode and erthe. By theyse meanes, and blowyng of fame, that
place was the more vysyted by women and undyscrete persones, of ye which some watchyd there ye
hoole nyght in prayer, so that the lenger this contynuyd, ye more disclaunder was anotyd to the justyces,
and to suche as put hym to deth: notwithstandynge, in processe of tyme when his actys were publysshed,
as ye sleigne of man with his owne hande, and uysyng of his concubyne within seynt Mary Church, in
tyme of his there beynge, as he openlye confessyd in the owre of his deth, with other detestable crymes,
somewhat keyld ye great flame of ye hasty pylgrymage; but not clerely tyll ye archebisshop of Canterbury
accursed ye preest that brought up the firste fable, and also causyd that place to be watchyd, that suche
idolatry shuld there no more be used.” (Fabyan’s <cite>Chronicles</cite>, p. 306.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The mention of the woman is also made by Holinshed. He adds a single
line which contains a world of love and pathos, the words, “who never left him
fearing danger might betide him.” Fabyan’s words “not without shedding of
blood” are by Holinshed shown to mean that one of his assailants thrust a knife
into William’s body, so that he was carried to the Tower. One pictures the
faithful, loving creature—was she his wife?—watching by the wounded man all
night, giving him such solace in the agony of his wound as she could, and
going out in the morning to see him die—or haply, to die with him. The
manner of his death was that which was ordered for William Wallace, a hundred
years later. William Longbeard and his friends were dragged by the heels
to Smithfield and then hanged. The distance from the Tower to Smithfield is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
a mile and a quarter. It is a long way for the body of a man to be dragged:
first the head and arms and back were bruised by the roughness of the road;
then the clothes were torn to rags; when the sufferer arrived at the gibbet he
was already senseless from the blows and buffets of his head against the stones
and rough places in the road; when he was hoisted up on the gibbet, his body,
stripped of the clothes, was bleeding and torn. Was that poor woman present?
Perhaps they took her to Smithfield in a cart and burned her alive.</p>

<p>The case, as I said, is one of a Reformer before his time. One knows not
all the reforms he desired and advocated. The example of his life, however,
and the tradition of his teaching, remained. The Archbishop might curse the
priest, or anybody there who defended him. But the fact remained that this
man died a martyr for the cause of justice against oppression and despotic rule.
Such a life is not wasted.</p>

<p>Then came the Commune with the struggle, begun by Longbeard, of the
craftsmen against the governing class, caused by their resolve to obtain their
share in the administration. It was in one sense fortunate for the City that
the factions and the struggles which divided the City were continually complicated
by the dissension of King and Barons. The issues were thus to a great extent
obscured, and what might have been civil war in the City became part of the
civil wars between the King and the Barons.</p>

<p>The reign of Henry the Third is filled with the King’s displeasure against
the City as well as with the quarrels and dissensions which rent the City in
twain. Let us run rapidly through the main incidents of the time, and then
consider how the growth and development of the Commune were affected by
those factions.</p>

<p>In the year 1221, or 1223, the tumult for which Constantine FitzArnult was
hanged awakened the jealousy and suspicion of the young King, because it revealed
the existence or the survival of a French party in the City. I cannot but think that
this foolish rising was the first cause of that hatred towards his rich city which
Henry entertained throughout his reign. The conspiracy, says Fabyan, was so
“heinous and grievous to the King that he was mynded and purposed to throwe
downe the wallys of the Citie.” However, for the time he was appeased, and
presently issued his Charter of Confirmation to the City with the grant of a common
seal.</p>

<p>In 1229 the Aldermen, with the consent of the people, agreed that a sheriff
should not continue in office for more than one year, because charges had been
brought against previous sheriffs of taking bribes from victuallers, and also of various
extortions. On referring to the list we find that the continuance in office of the
sheriffs had become of recent years a common practice, as the following list
(<cite>Stow</cite>) shows:—</p>

<p>In 1240, the Aldermen were elected and changed yearly, “but,” says Stow,
“that order lasted not long.” (See Appendices II. and III.)</p>

<p>In the same year, following Fabyan’s Chronology, the King began to side with
the popular party, intending in this manner to break up the privileges of the City.</p>

<p>At this point it is necessary to seek more closely into the reasons of the weakness
which made London an almost unresisting prey to the exactions of this insatiate
and insatiable King. The City, which could lend Simon de Montfort a fully
equipped army of 15,000 men, might surely at any moment close its gates, keep the
mouth of the Thames clear, and defy the King. But for many years it offered no
resistance at all. The reason will immediately appear. A change so slow and
gradual that it only at this juncture became important was passing over the City of
London and its institutions, or to put it more accurately, the institutions themselves
remained unchanged, yet assumed new meanings. It was, as has been
already advanced, the happiness of London that, except for a very brief episode, its
over-lord was the King and none other. The reeve of the borough was the bailiff
or steward of this lord. In the name of the lord he was the magistrate; he collected
rents, tolls and dues; he called the burgesses to their mote; he took care that the
rights of the lord were properly executed. These duties observed, the burgesses
were left at liberty to govern themselves. Naturally, when the town became
prosperous it began to buy out the privileges of the over-lord. Thus, the Charters
of the City of London are the recognition by king after king, that a certain portion
of the rights of the over-lord have been bought out or conceded. And the reign of
such a king as Henry the Third is a continual disregard of these concessions or
purchases, by the assertion over and over again of the rights and powers of the over-lord,
never, however, going so far as to give the City to any other over-lord. Thus
Henry, as we shall see, in spite of the Charters, held courts in the City by his own
justiciar, and called the citizens to plead their own cases at Westminster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>These Charters, then, granted their liberties to the citizens. But who were the
citizens? “Land was from the first the test of freedom, and the possession of land
was what constituted the townsman.... In England the landless man who dwelled
in a borough had no share in its corporate life: for purposes of government or
property the town was simply an association of the landed proprietors within its
bounds.” (Green’s <cite>History of the English People</cite>.)</p>

<p>These words explain the whole position. In the twelfth century the government
of London was entirely in the hands of certain families who held the land. As
we have seen, the wards were their own property, named after them: the heads of
these families were hereditary Aldermen of the wards. The members of this corporation
or association were themselves, for the most part, engaged in trade. They
were the wholesale traders—mercers, drapers, merchant adventurers. They would
not admit within their body the craftsmen, who began, however, to form guilds for
themselves. And the efforts of the governing body were directed against the
formation of the craft guilds which, they plainly saw, would lead to the destruction
of their own power. In the reign of Henry the Third this struggle of the <i lang="fr">Prud
hommes</i> or the “wise men”—the men of the ruling class—against the craftsmen
was at its fiercest. In the reign of John, they had secured the suppression of the comprehensive
weavers’ guild. Slow and difficult is the process and many are the lessons
which must be learned, great are the oppressions which must be endured, before
men so far overcome their suspicion of each other as to unite for the common good.
The Londoner—the man of the commonalty—of Henry the Third could unite for
fighting purposes; he could trust his brother to stand by him shoulder to shoulder;
what he could not do was to trust his brother-craftsman not to overreach him, or to
undersell him. Do we not see the same thing to-day? We think we are better
educated and wiser; and we are even now exhorting men to do exactly what these
popular leaders of the thirteenth century exhorted them to do, namely—to combine.
The commonalty, at first, were galled, not so much by having no share in the
administration, for they had never looked for any, but by the suspicion that the real
burden of taxation fell upon themselves instead of on the wealthy. The names of
the Mayors of this reign sufficiently indicate the side on which the power lay from
time to time. Thus Basing, Blunt, Bukerel, Frowyk, FitzWalter are names of the
old families: Le Fullour and Grapefig are the names of craftsmen.</p>

<p>Early in the long reign of Henry the Third we find a certain Symon FitzMary,
whose name perhaps indicates an origin so obscure that it was only derived from his
mother, yet he was one of the Aldermen, one of the popular party, and—which is
significant—in the service of the King. Henry, therefore, was playing off the
popular against the aristocratic side. Symon was elected Sheriff in the year 1233,
but in the first term of his shrievalty he was charged with “wasting the property
that formed the issues of the Sheriffwick.” He was, therefore, set aside,—surely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
very strong step,—and his clerks were ordered in his place to collect the money that
formed the <em>Firma</em>. Six years later, in 1239, Symon presents himself at the election
of sheriffs. He has letters from the King commanding the City to elect him. Here
we have a deliberate attempt of the King to trample on the Charters. The City
refused to obey, and repaired to Court in hopes of conciliating the King’s favour,
but could not, “so that,” says FitzThedmar, “the City was without a Mayor for
three months, when Gerard Bat, one of the aristocratic party, was elected.” At the
next election he was again chosen. Then follows a very curious story. With him
“certain of the citizens proceeded to Wodestok, for the purpose of presenting him;
and his lordship the King declined to admit him [to the Mayoralty] there, or before
he had come to London. And on the third day after, upon the King’s arrival there,
he admitted him; and after the oath had been administered to him, that he would
restore everything that had before been taken and received, and would not receive
the forty pounds which the Mayors had previously been wont to receive from the
City, the Mayor said, when taking his departure:—‘Alas! my Lord, out of all this
I might have found a marriage portion to give my daughter.’ For this reason the
King was moved to anger, and forthwith swore upon the altar of Saint Stephen, by
Saint Edward, and by the oath which he that day took upon that altar, and said:—‘Thou
shalt not be Mayor this year, and for a very little I would say, Never. Go,
now.’ The said Gerard, hereupon, not caring to have the King’s ill-will, resigned
the Mayoralty, and Reginald de Bunge was appointed Mayor of London.” (Riley’s
edit. FitzThedmar’s <cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>, p. 9.)</p>

<p>At the same time we find this oppressive King calling the citizens together at
Paul’s Cross, and asking their leave to pass over-seas to Gascony!</p>

<p>On his return, the King took the City into his own hand for harbouring a certain
Walter Bukerel without warrant, yet it was proved that Bukerel had been pardoned.
He “took the City into his own hand,” <i>i.e.</i> he suspended all the Charters and
Liberties; but he gave it to the Mayor, Ralph Aswy, for safe keeping. He then
marched north to fight the Scots, but on his return he forbade the sheriffs to perform
any of their functions. The City bought their pardon by paying a fine of £1000.</p>

<p>Again we find Symon FitzMary active at the election of the Sheriffs. It was in
1244. Now in 1229 the Aldermen had all taken oath that at no time would they
allow the same man to be Sheriff for two consecutive years. Symon, therefore,
understanding that it was proposed to re-elect Nicholas Bat, rose in his place and
called him a perjurer. Reading between the lines, we understand that the self-denying
ordinance of 1229 was a concession to the popular party, and the re-election
of Bat in 1244 was due to the return to power of the other side. There was certainly
a warm debate, and in the end Symon had to resign his Aldermanry, and Nicholas
Bat was re-elected. The case, however, was taken before the King, who refused to
admit Nicholas Bat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>To this time belongs a series of determined attacks upon the liberties of the
City by the King. There was first the case of Margery Vyel; then the claims of
the Abbot of Westminster; and thirdly, the Fair of Westminster. The Fair was
granted to the Abbot of Westminster for fifteen days, to be held in Tothill Fields.
During its continuance, trade of all kinds was to cease in London. Consider the
intolerable nature of this enactment. The City bought off the latter regulation for
the sum of £2000. As regards the claims of Westminster Abbey, they were complicated
by questions of mediæval law and rights; for a long time they were advanced
as a means of worrying the City. Thus, in 1249, the King appointed a “day of
love” (<i>i.e.</i> reconciliation) between the City and the Abbot of Westminster. The
meeting was held at the Temple. The Mayor, being accompanied by a “countless
multitude,” met the Abbot, who had with him certain of the King’s Justices. But
there was no conference; the whole of the people, with one consent, declared that
they would have no conference, but would abide by their Charters. The case was
taken before the King, but nothing seems to have been decided.</p>

<p>This brings us to the claim of Margery Vyel. It is related by Arnold FitzThedmar.
Let us use his own words as far as possible.</p>

<p>“In the same year”—<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1246—“on the Monday next after Hockeday
[Hocking day was the second Tuesday after Easter] it was adjudged in the Guildhall
that a woman who had been endowed with a certain and specified dower may not,
nor ought to have of the chattels of her deceased husband beyond the certain and
specified dower assigned to her, unless in accordance with the will of her husband.
And this befel through Margery, the relict of John Vyel the elder, who, by numerous
writs of his Lordship the King, demanded in the Hustings of London, the third
part of the chattels belonging to her said husband.”</p>

<p>In the next year (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1247)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> “on the Monday after St. Peter Chains [St.
Peter ad Vincula, August 1st] Henry de Ba, a Justiciar sent by his Lordship the
King, came to St. Martin’s-le-Grand, where the record which had been given upon
complaint of Margery Vyel was, to which judgment the said Margery had made
complaint to his Lordship the King, and had found judges to prove that the same
was false. Whereupon the Mayor and citizens meeting them, the record having
been read through, and all the writs of his Lordship the King which the said
Margery had obtained having been read and heard, the Justiciar said, ‘I do not say
that this judgment is false, but the process thereof is faulty, as there is no mention
made in this record of summons of the opponents of the said Margery, and seeing
that John Vyel, her husband, made a will, it did not pertain to your Court to
determine such a plea as this.’ To which the citizens made answer ‘There was no
necessity to summons those who had possession of the property of the deceased for
they were always ready, and preferred to stand trial at suit of the said Margery in
our Court: and besides, we were fully able to entertain such plea by assent of the
two parties, who did not at all claim or demand the Ecclesiastical Court and seeing
that his Lordship the King by his writ commanded us to determine the same.’</p>

<p>At length after much altercation had taken place between the Justiciar and the
citizens, the Justiciar said that they must show all this to the King and his Council
and so they withdrew. Afterwards, however, and solely for this cause, the King
took the city into his own hands and by his writ entrusted it to the custody of
William de Haverille and Edward de Westminster, namely, on the vigil of St.
Bartholomew (Aug. 24th): whereupon the Mayor and citizens went to the King at
Wudestok and showed him that they had done no wrong: but they could not regain
his favour. Wherefore, upon their arrival at London, William de Haverille exacted
an oath of the clerks and all the serjeants who belonged to the Shrievalty, that they
would be obedient unto him, the Mayor and Sheriffs being removed from their
bailiwicks. Afterwards, on the Sunday before the Nativity of St. Mary (Sept. 8th)
the Mayor and Sheriffs, by leave of the King, received the City into their hands
and a day was given them to make answer as to the aforesaid judgment before the
King and his Barons, namely, the morrow of the Translation of St. Edward [June
9th] at Westminster, and on the morrow of St. Edward, the Mayor and citizens
appeared at Westminster to make answers to the judgment before mentioned, that
had been given against the aforesaid Margery Vyel and so on from day to day till
the fourth day, upon which last day, the King requested them to permit the Abbot
of Westminster to enjoy the franchises which the King had granted him in Middlesex
in exchange for other liberties which the citizens might of right demand. To
which the citizens made answer that they could do nothing in such a matter without
the consent of the whole community. The King on learning this, as though moved
to anger, made them appear before him and after much altercation had passed as to
the said judgment (Henry de la Mare a kinsman of the before named Margery Vyel
constantly making allegations against the citizens) counsel being at last held before
the King between the Bishops and Barons, the Mayor and citizens were acquitted
and took their departure.” (Riley’s edition, FitzThedmar’s <cite>Chronicles of Old
London</cite>.)</p>

<p>It will be observed that the King broke the Charters, first by sending his
own Justiciar into the City to hear an appeal; next, by making the Mayor and
citizens go to Westminster to have a City case tried; and thirdly, by granting the
Abbot of Westminster rights or privileges in the County of Middlesex which was
held and farmed by the City.</p>

<p>The City, at the price of surrendering its liberties, won the case, evidently a
case considered as of the very highest importance. The reward bestowed upon
Symon FitzMary is related by FitzThedmar:</p>

<p>“It should be observed, that when Symon FitzMary, for his offence, had
delivered his Aldermanry into the hands of the City, as above noticed, by assent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the whole community the Mayor returned him his Aldermanry, upon condition of
his conceding that if at any future time he should again contravene the franchises
of the City, the Mayor might, without plea or gainsaying, take back his Aldermanry,
into the hands of the City, and wholly remove him therefrom. Wherefore, in this
year, because the said Symon had manifestly sided with Margery Vyel in the
complaint which she had made to his lordship the King as to the judgment given
by the citizens—as to which, as is already written, she herself was cast—as also,
for many other evil and detestable actions of which he had secretly been guilty
against the City, the Mayor took his Aldermanry into his own hands, and wholly
removed him therefrom; and the men of that Ward, receiving liberty to elect on
the Monday before Mid-Lent chose Alexander le Ferrun, and that too in his
absence; but he, afterwards appearing at the Hustings, was on the Monday following
admitted Alderman.” (<cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>, pp. 16-17.)</p>

<p>And so Symon vanishes. One would like to hear more of his political career.
As regards his private history, his will, by which he founded the House of St.
Mary of Bethlehem, survives, so that he is the originator of the Royal Bethlehem
Hospital, which has served the City so well and so long. He may have been of
humble origin, in which case he is an early example of the rise of a poor lad to
wealth, an example that after his time became well-nigh impossible until the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1257 occurred another of the many strange stories of this time. A sealed
Roll was found in the King’s wardrobe at Windsor. No one knew who wrote it, or
how it came there. The Roll contained “many articles against the Mayor, to the
effect that the City had been aggrieved by him and his abettors beyond measure,
as well as in respect of tallage and of other injuries that had been committed by
them.” In other words, the Roll contained a statement, no doubt highly coloured,
of the discontented. The King, pretending to be resolute that the poor should
not be treated unjustly, sent John Maunsell, Justiciar, to London with orders to
hold a Folk Mote and to inquire into the truth of the allegations, which was
done. Then the Aldermen were ordered to convene their ward motes, and to
cause the people in each ward to elect six-and-thirty deputies, <em>the Aldermen being
absent</em>; and these six-and-thirty men were ordered to appear in the hall of the
Bishop of London. They were there put on oath; but they refused to make oath,
alleging that by the laws of the City they ought not to make oath except upon
a question of life or limb, or where land was to be lost or gained. The next day,
at the Guildhall, the deputies still refused to take oath. Whereupon the King sent
word that all he desired was to learn the truth; that he was willing to leave their
franchises unimpaired, and that he desired to ascertain how his faithful people had
been aggrieved in tallages and by whom. Then John Maunsell spoke pleasantly to
the people, asking if they were not content with the promise of the King. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
they shouted, “Yea, Yea,” “in disparagement,” says the Chronicler, who belonged
to the City Barons, “of their own franchises, which, in fact, these most wretched
creatures had not been the persons to secure.”</p>

<p>John Maunsell then proceeded to seize the City for the King, and to depose
the Mayor, Sheriffs, and City Chamberlain. There was a trial at Westminster
before the King; there was another Folk Mote, at which the people were persuaded
by the silver-tongued John Maunsell to shout for the destruction of their own
liberties, of which they understood little indeed. The Chronicler, in indignation,
calls them “sons of divers mothers, many of them born without the City, and many
of servile condition.” At that time, one observes, they were very far from the
possibility of a democracy.</p>

<p>The popular cause never fails, in any age, to attract to itself leaders from
the other side. William FitzOsbert, whose rise and fall we have already chronicled,
had attempted to do for the commonalty, in King Richard’s reign, what Thomas
FitzThomas attempted with greater success seventy years later. He was Sheriff
during the sealed Roll business; his brother, Sheriff Matthew Bukerel, was
deposed, and was replaced by a person whose name has already been mentioned,
William Grapefig. William FitzRichard, another of the popular party, was made
Mayor. In 1261-62, and in 1262-63, Thomas FitzThomas was elected Mayor,
certainly by the people, as the names of the Sheriffs for the year imply that they
had the upper hand for the time. His first year of office was marked by the stout
resistance which he made to the Constable of the Tower, who attempted to take
“prisage” of ships in the river. Now, one of the most important privileges of the
City was the command of the river, so that no duties or tolls should be levied on
ships coming up or going down the river except by themselves. FitzThomas was
elected for a second year of office. And now you shall hear, what in the thirteenth
century was thought by a merchant of the old school, of a man who could
encourage the combination of trades and crafts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>
<p>“Be it here remarked<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> that this Mayor, during the time of his Mayoralty, had
so pampered the City populace that, styling themselves the ‘Commons of the City,’
they had obtained the first voice in the City. For the Mayor, in doing all that he
had to do, ruled and determined through them, and would say to them, ‘Is it your
will that so it shall be?’ and then if they answered, ‘Yea, Yea,’ so it was done.
And, on the other hand, the Aldermen or chief citizens were little or not at all
consulted in such matter; but were, in fact, just as though they had not existed.
Through this that same populace became so elated and so inflated with pride
that during the commotions in the realm, of which mention has been previously
made, they formed themselves into covins and leagued themselves together by oath,
by the hundred and by the thousand, under a sort of colour of keeping the peace,
whereas they themselves were manifestly disturbers of the peace. For whereas the
Barons were only fighting against those who wished to break the aforesaid statutes,
and seized the property of each and that too by day, the other broke into the houses
of the people and of other persons in the City who were not against the said
statutes and by main force carried off the property found in such houses, besides
doing many other unlawful acts as well. As to the Mayor, he censured these
persons in but a lukewarm way.” (<cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>, p. 59.)</p>

<p>Further, the barons, wishing above all things at this juncture to conciliate the
citizens, desired that they would put in writing anything they might desire in
augmentation of their liberties, and undertook, if the thing were reasonable, to bring
it before the King and Council. Then this Mayor called upon the craftsmen and
ordered them to make such provisions as should be to their own advantage.
“Accordingly, after this, from day to day, individuals of every craft of themselves
made new statutes and provisions, or rather such as may be called ‘abominations’—and
that solely to their own advantage, and to the intolerable loss of all merchants
coming to London and visiting the faire of England and the exceeding injury of all
persons in the realm.”</p>

<p>This was the first trades union. Their rules were drawn up by the working
men themselves. The memory of the old frith guilds had by this time perished,
but there were fraternities, or religious associations, which would help them to some
knowledge of the rules which they should lay down. Such as they were, the
Chronicler tells us, they were not carried into effect.</p>

<p>In 1263-64 Thomas FitzThomas was again elected Mayor; but the King
refused to receive him, being “for many reasons greatly moved to anger against
the City.”</p>

<p>In the same year began the Barons’ War, in which the Londoners played a
conspicuous, if not a noble, part. They reduced the castle of Rochester; they
destroyed the palace at Isleworth, belonging to Richard, the King’s brother; they
murdered five hundred Jews; they pillaged the property of the foreign merchants;
and at the battle of Lewes they ran away.</p>

<p>Peace being made in the following year, Henry, now a prisoner, was made to
hold a Court in St. Paul’s, where the Mayor, again Thomas FitzThomas, and the
Aldermen swore fealty to him. A marginal note of the Chronicle completes the
history of this oath. “Then those who were present might see a thing wondrous
and unheard of in this age: for the most wretched Mayor, when taking the oath,
dared to utter words so rash as these, saying unto his lordship the King in presence
of the people, ‘My lord, so long as unto us you will be a good lord and King, we
will be faithful and duteous unto you.’” The Mayor was four hundred years before
his time.</p>

<p>After the defeat and death of Simon de Montfort at Evesham, there was great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
alarm in the City. Some proposed to close the gates and call together the
adherents of the Barons’ cause; others proposed immediate submission. The
latter course prevailed. Letters of submission were drawn up and sent to the King
at Windsor. The messengers on the way met Sir Roger de Lilbourne, who told
them that he was sent to declare the King’s pleasure to the citizens. The King’s
pleasure was immediate and complete submission: the removal of all chains and
posts in the streets as a mark of submission, and the despatch of the Mayor and
principal men of the City to Windsor under letters of safe conduct. They went.
FitzThomas, unluckily, was once more Mayor. The King disregarded the letters of
safe conduct and clapped them into prison. All of them, except FitzThomas, were
shortly afterwards released. Henry remembered the words by which FitzThomas
had sworn a limited loyalty. FitzThomas never again appeared. He vanished.
Perhaps the King ordered his execution; perhaps he caused him to languish for the
rest of his life in prison. However that may be, FitzThomas was no more seen.</p>

<p>Henry came to London, his chief enemy in custody; he gave away sixty
houses belonging to the principal citizens; he fined the City 20,000 marks. On the
6th of December of the same year (1265) John de la Linde, knight, and John Wallraven,
clerk, were made seneschals, the Tower of London being delivered into their
hands. On the same day there came to Westminster four-and-twenty citizens, who
swore faithfully and safely to keep the City in the King’s behalf under their two
seneschals.</p>

<p>The King gave, further, London Bridge, with its tolls, to Queen Eleanor, who
allowed it to fall into decay. She then gave it back to the City.</p>

<p>FitzThedmar here remarks that some of the persons who had sided with the Earl
of Gloucester took to flight, and there were among them some who, in the time of
the late Mayor, FitzThomas, styled themselves the “Commons of the City.” On the
election of a citizen “to attend to the duties of Sheriff of Middlesex and Warden of
London,” the people clamoured for FitzThomas, who was probably by this time
lying in his grave.</p>

<p>The citizens petitioned, but in vain, for the right of electing their Mayor and
Sheriffs. In the following year, 1266, John Adrian and Luke de Battencurt were
chosen Bailiffs instead of Sheriffs.</p>

<p>Out of the confusion and trouble of the time we can gather that the trade of
London was brought to a standstill; that there were massacres of Jews; that there
were riots in the streets, quarrels between trades, in one of which as many as 500
men went out armed and fought in the streets; that the trades continued to combine
and to form companies, but without rule and supervision, so that they claimed work
belonging to other trades, and caused ill-feeling; that there was no order kept in
the wards, and no authority of the Aldermen. The Mayors, during the period
following the Battle of Evesham, were appointed by the King. Fabyan says that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
there is uncertainty about this time, some being of opinion that there were no
Mayors but only <i lang="la">custodes</i>. Fabyan also says that Thomas FitzThomas was released.
He enters his name as Mayor for 1269-70. But his dates do not agree with those
of Stow. In the latter year Prince Edward took the City into his own hands and
appointed Hugh FitzOtho Constable of the Tower and Custos of the City. A few
months of despotic and military rule smoothed the troubled waters of faction and
restored order to the distracted City. The last years of King Henry’s reign were
years of peace and rest. But he had done what he wished to do—he had deprived
the proud City of its wealth, its liberty, and its rights.</p>

<p>The first phase of the contest between the oligarchy and the populace comes to
an end. The former party is greatly broken up; the wards cease to be called by
the names of their Aldermen.</p>

<p>In December 1269 an order was issued by the King that all those persons
who, on the restoration of the City to him, had withdrawn, should be proclaimed
publicly, and should be forbidden ever to return to the City under pain of life and
limb. Their names were read out in the Guildhall and afterwards cried in the
streets. There were fifty-seven of them; the list has been preserved by FitzThedmar.
All, with a few exceptions, were craftsmen. Cofferer, Baker, Cook,
Goldsmith, Ironworker, Fuller, Plumer, Broker, Butcher, Armourer, Chaloner,
with a few mercers and others belonging to wholesale trades.</p>

<p>This act of justice accomplished, the citizens were once more granted the right
of electing their Mayor and Sheriffs, but with the increase of the <em>firma</em> from £300
to £400.</p>

<p>They proceeded to exercise this right, apparently, with sadness and soberness,
and with a compromise. The Mayor was John Adrian, of the aristocratic party;
the Sheriffs were two craftsmen. The following year Walter Hervey, a man of
the people, was Mayor, and two of the other side were Sheriffs.</p>

<p>The election of the Mayor of the following year is a most interesting and
instructive story. Fabyan, we may observe, puts the election in the second year of
Edward’s reign; Arnold FitzThedmar, one of the Aldermen concerned, and therefore
an eye-witness, assigns it to the last days of King Henry and the earliest days of
King Edward.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, the Feast of St. Simon and St. Jude, the citizens met
at the Guildhall for the election of the new Mayor. The Aldermen and the more
“discreet” citizens—it is one of them who tells the tale—proposed the name of
Philip le Tayllor. According to usage, their nominee ought to have been accepted;
but the people in the body of the Hall refused to accept him, and cried out with a
great tumult, “Nay, nay, we will have no one but Walter Hervey,” and against the
will of the Aldermen—one pictures a good deal of hustling and pushing—they
placed their own man in the seat of the Mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>It is not surprising that the same kind of accusations, which had formerly been
brought against William Longbeard and Thomas FitzThomas, were now brought
against Walter Hervey. He is said to have persuaded and promised the people
that he would keep them free from all tallages, extortions, and tolls, and that they
believed his word, and followed him by thousands, even in multitudes, without
number. We remember that 50,000 are said to have followed Longbeard. The
charge of gaining over the people by grand promises is very likely true; the
demagogue has always resorted to the same methods of persuasion; in the end to
the detriment or the ruin of the cause. One understands that the more popular
leaders of London between 1190 and 1272 were men who desired, above all things,
to render impossible the burden of unequal taxation, and to give the commons a
voice in the management of their own affairs. This twofold aim is really one,
because it was believed that the people, if they had the power, would exercise it
wisely and justly. The leaders, however, did not realise that the average man
understands by justice the shifting of his burden to the shoulders of some other
man, and he is quite careless who that other man is.</p>

<p>Hervey, however, had the people with him.</p>

<p>The Aldermen, finding themselves thrust, in this rude way, out of power,
repaired to Westminster to lay the matter before the King’s Council. They were
followed by Hervey himself, accompanied by a vast multitude of his supporters.
The case of the Aldermen was put with much ability: it was not the loss of their
own power which they so much minded, as the chance that another civil war might
be caused through the unruly pride of the populace.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Aldermen and their adherents, on coming before the King’s Council, as already written, showed
unto them, with grievous complaints, how that this populace by force had violently and unjustly impeded
their election, by those to whom the election of Mayor and Sheriffs in the City of right more particularly
belongs than to any one else, and has always been wont to belong. They also duteously besought his
lordship the King and his Council, that the King would be pleased to set his arm and his hand thereto,
that so this populace, calling itself the ‘Commons of the City,’ and excluding the Aldermen and discreet
men of the City, might not upraise itself against his peace and against the peace of his realm, as had
happened in the time of the Earl of Leicester; namely, when Thomas Fitz-Thomas and Thomas de
Pullesdon had so exalted the populace of the City above the Aldermen and discreet men of the City, that,
when it was necessary so to do, they could not make such populace amenable to justice; through which,
as a thing notorious to the whole world, a deadly war arose in England.” (Riley’s edit., FitzThedmar’s
<cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>, pp. 154-155.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The people, without caring to answer these arguments, raised the cry: “We
are the Commons. To us belongs the Election. We elect Walter Hervey.”</p>

<p>It was a time of great anxiety. The King was ill; he was now old—for that
time, very old; the heir was in the Holy Land; it was most desirable that the peace
should be maintained.</p>

<p>The Aldermen went on arguing. The same arguments were used before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
passing of every successive Reform Act. The Aldermen pointed out that they were
the heads, the people being only the inferior members, arms and legs; the Aldermen
were also, by right of office, those who pronounced judgment in pleas moved within
the City; they had a stake in the country; the populace, on the other hand, for the
most part had neither lands nor houses, were of obscure and lowly origin, followed
humble occupations, were rude and ignorant, and cared nothing about the City’s
welfare. The people, however, kept up their bawling, which reached the ears of the
King on his sickbed.</p>

<p>The Council, therefore, put the matter off. Hervey was told to go away and
to return with no more than ten or a dozen followers. So for that day he went
away.</p>

<p>On the morrow, after dinner, Hervey called all the people together, and, with
them at his heels, went again to Westminster, and there, setting forth no reason,
they kept up the same cry. The Aldermen were there before them. The Council
told both parties that they must agree upon a Mayor, and that when they were
agreed the King would admit him.</p>

<p>But they could not agree; there was no chance of an agreement. So, day
after day, for a whole fortnight, viz. till the 11th of November, the people became
more excited every day, and the Aldermen more dogged, and the same tumultuous
scene was enacted in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>As for Hervey, he affirmed—very likely he spoke the truth, for the situation
was full of peril, and one could not forget the vanishing of FitzThomas—that he did
not desire to be Mayor for his own sake, but solely for the love of God and from
motives of charity; he was willing to endure that burden and that labour, that so he
might support the poor of the City against the rich, who sought to oppress them in
the matter of the tallages and expenditure of the City.</p>

<p>It speaks a great deal for the veracity of the historian that one who stood
among the Aldermen and took part in the offices, seeing his authority and power
suddenly taken from him, should have penned these words without casting a doubt
upon the motives which actuated his enemy.</p>

<p>On the 11th of November the Council, who appear to have acted with strange
weakness and irresolution, decided that as they could not agree, the King would
take the City into his own hands and would appoint a Custos or Warden.
Accordingly, Henry de Frowyk, one of the Aldermen (his Ward was afterwards
called Cripplegate) was appointed Warden.</p>

<p>It was then agreed that each side should appoint five persons, and that this
Committee of ten should elect the Mayor, both sides promising to abide by the
decision.</p>

<p>The death of the King caused this agreement to be set aside. There was
a fear lest the populace should take advantage of the confusion caused by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
absence of the new King; FitzThedmar converts a vague anxiety into the discovery
of a conspiracy against the property of the Aldermen. The Archbishop of York,
with the Earl of Gloucester and other nobles, met the citizens at Guildhall, and, seeing
the enormous number of Hervey’s followers, exhorted the Aldermen to elect him.
They still refused; they would not, of their own free will, lay down their powers;
they told Gloucester that the matter was referred to the Committee of ten.</p>

<p>The Earl, however, disregarding this arrangement, ordered a Folk Mote to be
called for the next day at Paul’s Cross, met the Aldermen separately in the Chapter
House, and begged them to yield and to suffer Hervey to be Mayor for one year,
lest trouble should fall upon the City. They therefore gave way, and Hervey, after
taking oath that he would not aggrieve or allow to be aggrieved, any who had been
against his election, was presented to the people, amid their joyous acclamations, as
their Mayor.</p>

<p>His year of office proved uneventful. FitzThedmar says that he took bribes
from the bakers, so that they might make loaves under weight, but we need not
believe this story; and that he would not allow any pleading, or very rarely any, in
the Hustings of Pleas of Land. “The reason being that he himself was impleaded
as to a certain tenement which Isabella Bukerel demanded of him by plea between
them moved.” Arnold, we observe, still harbours resentment.</p>

<p>At the following election the Aldermen carried their own man, Henry
Waleys, or le Waleys. He was one of the richest and most important merchants.
He was again Mayor from 1280 to 1283. He had been Mayor of Bordeaux in
1275.</p>

<p>We have seen how, according to the Chronicler, the craftsmen made covins and
combinations—in other words, trade unions, being exhorted thereto by Thomas
FitzThomas. It appears that when Walter Hervey was Mayor he confirmed these
combinations by Charters of his own granting regulation of trade for the common
benefit. Now we have the first instance of a blackleg. One of the persons who
had obtained, for his own benefit probably, such a Charter, came before the Mayor
and citizens in the Guildhall with the complaint that a certain person of his trade was
working in contravention of the statutes contained in the Charter, which he and his
trade had obtained. From whom, he was asked, had they obtained that Charter?
From Walter Hervey, when he was Mayor. “And here it is,” he said, producing
a copy of the document. “It is true,” said Walter Hervey; “I granted that Charter
by my authority as Mayor.” Then arose Gregory de Rokesley, Alderman, and one
of the most “discreet” men in the city. “Such Charters,” he said, “have no force
beyond the Mayoralty of the man who may grant them. Moreover, these Charters
were only made for the benefit of the rich men in every craft, not for that of the
poor: and they lead to the loss and undoing of the poor men as well as the loss of
all other citizens and the realm.” Whereupon Walter Hervey sprang to his feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and there ensued a warm and personal discussion. Finally, Walter Hervey retired
to St. Peter’s Church, Cornhill, where he convened the people and exhorted them
to keep their Charters, which he would take care should be enforced; and the whole
of that day and the next he went through the City haranguing the people, so that
the Barons of the Exchequer and the King’s Council feared a popular tumult.
Therefore they sent the Royal command to the City to take care lest, through the
action of the said Walter Hervey and others, mischief should ensue. The City
Magistrates interpreted this order to mean the arrest of Hervey. Which was done,
but on the surety of twelve men he was released. This happened just before
Christmas. After Christmas, the Mayor called a meeting in the Guildhall and
ordered Hervey’s Charters to be brought to him. A fortnight later he caused them
to be read, and explained that they would lead to the detriment and ruin of trade;
that the Charters carried no weight and were worthless; that the men of every craft
should resume their former liberty to follow their trade wherever and in whatever
way they pleased; only that their work must be good and true. In other words, the
Charters which Hervey had given them were intended to teach the people the
necessity of order and discipline in order to gain their rights; and this Mayor led
them gently back, under pretence of giving them liberty, to resume their old
dependence. But they had not done yet with Walter Hervey. It remained to
deprive him of his dignity as Alderman of Chepe. This was done full craftily. The
greater part of the Ward of Chepe consisted of a market-place filled with sheds, selds,
and shops. The sheds are explained by Stow to mean small, open shops, each with
a “solar” or small upper chamber over them. One such “shed” remained till the
other day close to Clare Market.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The selds were wooden warehouses with shops.
The tradesmen of this market, the greatest and most important in the kingdom,
were the special friends of Hervey, his constituents, who had made him Alderman.
Whereupon, in order to get rid of Hervey, these people must also be got rid of.
The King’s Coronation suggested an expedient. Although the traders, butchers,
fishmongers, and those of other callings, had paid large sums of money for the rent
or permission to set up their shops in the market, the Mayor sent word that in order
to clean the place of all refuse, when the King should ride through Chepe, they must
all go and sell their wares in other places. Then, in the words of the Chronicle—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“On the morrow of Holy Trinity, the Mayor and citizens coming into the Guildhall to plead the
common pleas, there came certain fishmongers, and more especially those who had been removed from Chepe.
To whom answer was made by the Mayor, that this had been done by the Council of his lordship the King,
in order that there might be no refuse remaining in Chepe on his arrival there. Walter Hervi, however,
to the utmost of his power, supported the complaints of the said fishmongers against the Mayor and
Aldermen: by reason whereof a stormy strife arose, in presence of all the people, between the said Mayor
and Walter aforesaid. Hereupon the Mayor, moved to anger, together with some of the more discreet of
the City, went to the Council of his lordship the King at Westminster and showed him what had then taken
place in Guildhall. Accordingly, on the morrow, when the Mayor and Aldermen had come to the
Guildhall, to determine the pleas which had been begun on the preceding day, a certain roll was shown
and read before the said Walter and all the people, in which were set forth many articles as to the presumptuous
acts and injuries, of most notorious character, which the said Walter had committed while
Mayor, against the Commons of the City and in contravention of his oath: whereupon the said Walter
was judicially degraded from his aldermanry and he was excluded from the Council of his City.
Command was also given to the men dwelling in that aldermanry to choose a fit and proper man to be
Alderman of Chepe in his place and to present him at the next Court in the Guildhall, which was
accordingly done.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So vanishes the form of Walter Hervey. He takes off his Alderman’s gown;
he steps down among the folk, a plain citizen, and I daresay that the craftsmen, next
day, had forgotten all that he had tried to do for them. But the memory of those
Charters survived.</p>

<p>And so they made a political end of this reformer. To him, however, belongs
the credit of creating or reviving the spirit of union and incorporation of the trades.
I say reviving, because one must not forget the “adulterine” guilds of Henry the
Second’s time; and because, wherever there was a guild for religious and charitable
purposes, the other trade guild for commercial and practical purposes was not far off.</p>

<p>We have seen how, within forty years from this time, the wards ceased to
be named after their Aldermen and their proprietors. In this interval there took
place a silent revolution, the steps of which it is now difficult, or even impossible,
to follow. The nature of the revolution is indicated by the rapid rise of the
companies in the next few years. The authority of the aristocratic party was
broken, though not yet destroyed; the shadow of their old power in giving their
names to the wards vanished also. We shall now find the government of London
transferred from the Aldermen to the trades.</p>

<p>The memory of the three early reformers, William Longbeard, Thomas
FitzThomas, and Walter Hervey, should be better known to those who care about
the origin and the history of civic liberties. They appear to me to bear a striking
resemblance to each other. All three belonged to the aristocratic class; all
three deserted their own people, and were bitterly reviled in consequence; all
three surrendered their own interests; all three were filled with that overwhelming
passion for justice which makes martyrs and carries on a cause. It is to be
hoped that while the first was dragged by the heels to the gallows, while the
second was murdered in a dungeon, while the third was put out of office and
deprived of the right to speak and the power to act, some vision of the future
was vouchsafed to them; some voice whispered in their dying ears that their
life’s work was not lost, but would yet bear fruit in the coming freedom of the
people for whom they had worked and for whom they suffered.</p>

<p>The long continuance of these factions, the civil wars, the disorders of the
last reign, could not fail to produce the worst effects in the condition of the City.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
The streets were full of murders, robberies, house-breaking, and violence of all
kinds. The first attempt to restore order seems to have been the recognition
that a strong and permanent hand was wanted. Accordingly, we find the office
of Mayor filled for twelve years by two men taking the post each for two or three
years together. They were merchants of the aristocratic party; they were personal
friends holding the same views, and those not of a democratic kind; they were
wealthy; they bestowed large benefactions upon the City; they were trusted by
the King. Yet they did not succeed. Loftie is of opinion that they were too
much occupied with their own affairs, and were compelled to leave much of their
proper work to subordinates. On the other hand, they may have been very great
merchants, yet not good administrators. The earlier pages of Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite>
are filled with cases of murder and violence. There were excellent laws made
for the preservation of peace. Nothing could have been better than the
following:—</p>

<p>(1) Every trade to present the names of persons practising that trade, where
they dwell and in what ward. This ordinance proves that all the trades had
their guilds or unions.</p>

<p>(2) The Aldermen to inquire as to lodgers in hostelries.</p>

<p>(3) To provide security for suspected persons.</p>

<p>(4) Two serjeants to stand at each gate to watch persons entering or leaving
the City.</p>

<p>(5) Curfew to be rung in every parish church, taking the time from St. Martin-le-Grand.</p>

<p>At Curfew all the gates to be closed; the taverns to be shut; no persons to
walk about the streets; six persons to watch in every ward.</p>

<p>(6) No one to cross the river at night.</p>

<p>(7) The serjeants of Billingsgate and Queen Hythe to guard the river, each
with his boat and crew of four men.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of these regulations, the condition of the City became worse
instead of better. The case of Lawrence Duket in 1284, which ended in the
hanging of seven men of good family, and the burning of one woman, caused general
discontent and murmuring. Finally, Edward resolved upon taking the conduct
of the City into his own hands. The way in which this was effected shows that
the comedy was agreed upon beforehand, so that everybody’s dignity should be
respected.</p>

<p>The Mayor was Gregory de Rokesley. He was ordered by the King’s
Lieutenant to repair with the Aldermen and Sheriffs to the Tower, there to
answer certain questions concerning the condition of the City. He obeyed, but
left behind him in the Church of Allhallows Barking, the gowns and chains of
office, excusing himself on the ground that the citizens only pleaded or answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
pleas within their own boundaries. He was arrested and kept in the Tower,
with the other officers, for a day or two. Meantime, as the City was technically
without a Mayor, the King used the fact as a pretext for taking it into his own
hands. He did so, appointing Sir Ralph Sandwich as Custos or Warden. The
City was kept under the rule of Sandwich and his successor, Sir John Breton,
for twelve years. They were, in fact, permanent Mayors, who could not be displaced
by the citizens, yet who took the Aldermen into counsel. The rule of these two
Wardens was remarkable for many reforms, including the definition of the wards,
the cleansing of the Walbrook, the suppression of night fairs, the repair of bridges,
the restoration of order. Trade was carried on freely and prosperously, the trade
guilds had leisure to consolidate themselves, so that they became, long before
they got their Charters, necessary for the business of the City; London had
assumed a new face when, in 1298, Edward gave back the Mayor, and Henry
Waleys once more assumed office. Not that violence altogether ceased, but that
violence was less frequent and more likely to be punished.</p>

<p>We have seen how the opinions of Lollardy were wide-spread among the
people during the fourteenth century. The history of John of Northampton and
that of his rival, Nicholas Brembre, belong to the close of that century, and to the
conclusion of the struggle between the employers and the craftsmen.</p>

<p>John was born at Northampton of respectable parentage, as is proved by
the fact that he was received into the Drapers’ Company, always one of the
most exclusive of the City Guilds; he was Alderman in 1376, Sheriff in 1377,
one of the City members in 1378; in 1380 he was a Commissioner for the erection
of some kind of tower; and in 1381 he was Mayor. The first thing he did as
Mayor showed what his opinions were. He took into his own hands a great
part of the duties belonging to the Bishop’s Court. He caused all those persons,
men and women, who had committed acts of unchastity to have their hair cut
short, and then to be carried in public through the City, preceded by trumpets
and drums, for an open shame, the men being placed in pillory, the women in
thewe. A second offence demanded a similar punishment. For a third offence
they were expelled the City altogether. Next, he cut down the fees of the parish
clergy. A mass for the dead was to be charged no more than a farthing; a
baptism not more than forty pence; marriage not more than half a mark. Multiply
these figures by twenty, at least, to represent modern values: we have then, a
mass sung for five pence; a baptism for £3: 4: 8; and a marriage for very nearly
seven pounds. Does the cheapness of the mass indicate an unbelief in its efficacy?
He also signalised his Mayoralty by a persecution of the fishmongers, whose
monopoly he suppressed. Their offence, one supposes, was the high price at
which they retailed their fish. We must again remind ourselves that quite one-fourth
of the year was a time of fasting, so that it was most important that fish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
should be cheap, abundant, and fresh. John not only took away these privileges
from the fishmongers, but he degraded them. They were forbidden to sell fish
in the country at all; they were forced to sell it in town at a price fixed by the
Mayor; and they were not to be eligible for any office. John was re-elected
Mayor in the following year, 1382-83, which passed quietly. His successor, 1383-84,
was his enemy, Nicholas Brembre, by whom all the reforms of John were swept
away. In January 1384, John was bound over to keep the peace in the sum of
£5000; in the following month he was arrested by the Mayor. It was said that
he went about followed by four hundred of his adherents; it was also said that
he created a tumult. One of his men, Constantyn, a cordwainer, was hanged for
his share in a riot, and John was sent to Corfe Castle. Thence he was brought to
London, tried before a Council called by the King at Reading, and sentenced to
death by the King. The sentence was commuted, at the Queen’s personal
request, to imprisonment. So he was sent back to Corfe Castle. Then, for
some unknown reason, he was brought to the Tower, and again informed that
he was to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and again reprieved. He was
then sent to Tintagel Castle, reflecting, no doubt, that while there is life
there is hope, and that he had a friend in John of Gaunt who would not
forsake him.</p>

<p>John of Gaunt did not forsake him. He renewed, from time to time, his
efforts to effect his release; and he promised that John should not return to London
if he were released. Then Nicholas Brembre, Mayor for four years running,
asked the opinion of the Aldermen and Common Council as to the expediency of
releasing this terrible prisoner. They all agreed that it would be dangerous to
let him loose, even if he lived a hundred miles from the City. In 1389, however,
he was allowed to return, and his property was restored to him. But the Mayor
strictly forbade any discussions as to the quarrel between John of Northampton
and Nicholas Brembre.</p>

<p>To go back for a while and trace the career of Sir Nicholas Brembre is now
necessary. He was a wealthy grocer, son of Sir John Brembre, a knight and
country gentleman of Kent. One of the many examples which the City affords
of the country lad who was not a rustic, but a gentleman, coming to London to
make his fortune (see vol. i. p. 216).</p>

<p>As he purchased estates in Kent in 1372, and became an Alderman in 1376,
it seems reasonable to suppose that he was born about the year 1322. He
joined the aristocratic party in the City, which strove to deprive the Craft
Companies of any voice in the City, and was as strenuous a supporter of
Courtenay as he was an enemy of John of Northampton.</p>

<p>In 1377, when Staple, the Mayor, was deposed, Brembre was appointed in
his place. The year after Brembre was charged at the Parliament of Gloucester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
by Thomas of Woodstock, the King’s uncle, with negligence of duty on the
occasion of a riot, when—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Upon Cornhille in London, the men of that vicinity made assault upon the servants of the said Earl,
and beat and wounded them, and pursued them, when flying to his hostel, and broke and hewed down
the doors of the same with axes and other arms, the said Earl being then within and lying in his bed,
and, by reason thereof, no little alarmed; to the grievous damage of the said Earl, and so pernicious an
example to the whole realm; and all this, he alleged, had happened through the inexcusable slothfulness
of the said Nicholas, and he requested that redress should be made to him for the same.” (Riley’s
<cite>Memorials</cite>, p. 427.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Brembre, however, offered a full and complete reply to the charge, and
returned, says the contemporary authority, to his hostel with honour.</p>

<p>Thomas of Woodstock, however, neither forgot nor forgave, although Brembre
gave him a hundred marks by way of conciliation. And there follows a very
pretty passage, showing the spirit with which the City liberties were regarded:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Which transactions being thus related in order before the Mayor and the Common Council, each
one of them gave hearty thanks to the said Nicholas; knowing for certain that it was for no demerits
of his own, but for the preservation of the liberties of the City, and for the extreme love which he bore to
it, that he had undergone such labours and expenses. Wherefore, with one accord, by the said Mayor,
Aldermen, and all the rest of the Commoners, it was faithfully granted and promised, that the City
should keep the said Nicholas indemnified as to the said 100 marks, and also all other expenses by
reason of that matter by him incurred. And that the same might be kept in memory, orders were given
to the Common Clerk that it should thus be entered.” (Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite>, p. 428.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Brembre then became one of the two collectors of customs for the Port of
London, Geoffrey Chaucer being his comptroller. On the rising of the Commons,
Brembre, with Philpot and Walworth, rode to Smithfield with the King, and was
knighted for his services on that occasion.</p>

<p>It was after this that the great struggle between himself, as the leader of the
aristocratic party, and therefore of the great companies, and John of Northampton,
as the leader of the popular cause, took place. We have seen how John of
Northampton acted as Mayor (1381-1383). In the latter year Brembre was elected
Mayor, but it was by force of arms.</p>

<p>In January 1384 John was arrested, and, as we have seen, his follower,
Constantyn, was hanged by Brembre. In 1386, petitions were presented to
Parliament by ten of the City Companies, charging Brembre with tyrannical and
oppressive conduct, and especially in securing the re-election by violence. For
he filled the Guildhall with armed men, who ran upon those of the opposite faction
with great noise, shouting, “Kill! kill! lour poursuyvantz hydousement.”
Thomas of Woodstock, mindful of the old grudge, charged Brembre with plotting
in favour of Suffolk. Yet he escaped, and was admitted by the King into his
Council. In November 1387 he was again accused by Thomas of Woodstock
with treason. The other four of the King’s Council were also charged with
treason, viz. the Archbishop of York; Sir Robert Vere, Duke of Ireland;
Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and Tressillian, the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The King replied that he had taken them into his own protection. Nevertheless,
they all thought it prudent to fly in different directions.</p>

<p>The King sent for the Mayor. “How many archers and men-at-arms would
the City provide in case of necessity?” The Mayor returned an evasive reply;
he said that the citizens were only soldiers in defence of their City, as for himself,
he begged permission to retire from office.</p>

<p>The King left Windsor and took up his residence in the Tower, thinking
to have the City between himself and the Lords. But Thomas of Woodstock,
now Duke of Gloucester, with the Earls of Arundel, Nottingham, Warwick, and
Derby, hastened to London and demanded admission into the City. The citizens
hesitated; at last, however, they yielded, and the Lords, with all their array,
entered the City. It is significant of the condition of the City that the Lords
offered to mediate in the trade disputes, but their offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>Meantime Brembre, who had fled into Wales, was captured and brought to
London.</p>

<p>His trial took place as soon as Parliament met. There were thirty-nine
charges brought against him as one of the King’s Council. He asked for delay
to prepare his reply. This being refused, he offered wager of battle. All the
Lords and Commons present threw down their gauntlets, but it was ruled that it
was not a case for the ordeal by battle.</p>

<p>The trial was resumed the following day, the King, who was present, showing
himself entirely in favour of the prisoner. The case was placed in the hands of a
commission of Lords, who brought in a verdict of not guilty. But they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
going to allow Brembre to escape. They sent for the Mayor and Aldermen. Thus
(I quote R. R. Sharpe):—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One would have thought that with Nicholas Exton, his old friend and ally, to speak up for him,
Brembre’s life would now at least be saved, even if he were not altogether acquitted. It was not so,
however. The Mayor and Aldermen were asked as to their <em>opinion</em> (not as to their knowledge), whether
Brembre was cognisant of certain matters, and they gave it as their <em>opinion</em> that Brembre was more likely
to have been cognisant of them than not. Turning then to the Recorder, the lords asked him how stood
the law in such a case? To which he replied, that a man who knew such things as were laid to Brembre’s
charge, and knowing them failed to reveal them, deserved death. On such evidence as this, Brembre was
convicted on the 20th February, and condemned to be executed. He was drawn on a hurdle through the
City to Tyburn, showing himself very penitent, and earnestly desiring all persons to pray for him. At the
last moment he confessed that his conduct towards Northampton had been vile and wicked. Whilst
craving pardon of Northampton’s son, ‘he was suddenly turned off, and the executioner cutting his throat,
he died.’” (<cite>London and the Kingdom</cite>, vol. i. p. 237.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption">RICHARD II. CONSULTING WITH HIS FRIENDS IN CONWAY CASTLE
<br />MS. Harl. 1319.</div>
</div>

<p>The history of Brembre shows that he was a strong man, at least, and fearless
in a time when charges of treason were easily concocted and ruthlessly applied,
when the King, his protector, was young and weak, and when the other side, which
had with them the craftsmen of London, was strong and well-organised.</p>

<p>In looking upon the long struggle of the craftsmen against their employers,
there are certain considerations which we must not forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>It was really inevitable that the masters, the employers, would have the
control, such as I have pointed out, in every trade. The men, quite ignorant of
the very rudest principles of political economy, living from week to week, asking
at most nothing but the weekly wage and cheap food, presently began to question.
Why should the masters rule everything? Why should not the men command
their own wages and their own hours? The questions, which we hear all around
us at the present day, were asked six hundred years ago. The working men
formed combinations, or unions, of their own; they kept on trying to form these
combinations; the number of cases that have been recorded, which were certainly
not the whole number, or anything like it, prove a deep and widespread discontent,
and a sullen resolve of the working men to take, if possible, the management of
their work into their own hands. They failed, however, and their failure was
absolute and complete. They were brought before the Mayor and Aldermen;
their combinations were dissolved; they were sent back to their company; no
union, or association, or combination of working men was permitted to London
outside the company. Let me take one case in illustration, that of David
Brekenhof. This man, with half-a-dozen others, was brought before the Mayor,
charged with rebellion against employers. They had broken off from the company;
they had left the dwelling-places assigned to them; they had taken a house in
another parish; here they had set up workshops for themselves; they called
assemblies of other working men; they settled their own wages; they hustled
and wounded one of the masters who went to expostulate with them; they rescued
their companions from arrest when they were seized by the serjeants of the City.
This, you will observe, was a very determined effort, coupled with assemblies of
other working men, and backed by the appeal to arms. The sentence of the Mayor
shows how seriously the danger was regarded. He did not dare to arouse a spirit
of revenge among the working men. These offenders were left unpunished; they
were simply told to give up their house; to go back to their company, and to
resume work in obedience. And so David Brekenhof and his rebels vanish again
and we hear no more of them. And until the nineteenth century there were no
more combinations of working men in London.</p>

<p>With the ideas of the present day, this refusal to allow the craftsmen to
combine seems tyrannical. We must go back, however, to the ideas of the
thirteenth century. The assumption, the theory, the belief, that the working
classes ought to have any voice in the management of their own affairs, if it
lingered anywhere in London of the thirteenth century, was a survival of the
Folk Mote, the Citizens’ Parliament, of Paul’s Cross. The Folk Mote still
continued; it was used for party purposes; it had no real power, but it kept alive
the memory of power. It ceased to be held after the thirteenth century; it died
out when a Court of Common Council was formed, and it is significant that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the old Folk Parliament ceased to meet we hear no more of the revolt of working
men against the companies.</p>

<p>What a citizen like Whittington thought and said was something like this:
“In a great city the governing class should be wealthy, enlightened, and instructed.
It should know the ports of trade, the demand for imports, the markets for exports,
the limits of production, the figures which are needed to arrive at wages and retail
price. It must also, in an age of artificial courtesy, understand good manners,
and not be afraid to stand before kings. As for the men of the other class, who
have no knowledge, save of a single trade, it is best for the State that they should
be under rule and governance.” And to the best of his ability, Whittington, who
was a stern Magistrate yet a just man, did keep the people under rule and
governance. I believe that the mediæval masters were, as a rule, and up to their
lights, benevolent; they did look after their people; they gave them wages which
allowed a higher standard of living than was possible for any other working men
in the world; they looked after the old, and they brought up the young.</p>

<p>For myself, I cannot but think that had the craftsmen then obtained their
desire, the result would have been disastrous to the fortunes of the City. London
would have become another Ghent or Bruges; it would be, now, a city of deserted
trade. The time was not yet ready for the rule of the people by the people. They
wanted education, experience, suffering, before they were able to rule. As yet they
understood nothing, absolutely nothing, about liberties; they wanted nothing but
the control over their own work. I think, in a word, that Whittington’s views
were right for a man of Whittington’s time.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE CENTURY OF UNCERTAIN STEPS</small></h3>


<p>Whether the Mayor was elected immediately after the concession of the Commune,
or a year or two later, as happened in certain French towns, matters very little.
The point of importance is that even after his election, and that of the Council, his
powers were ill-defined. During the reign of Richard the First, while he was not
even recognised by the King, we can understand that a wise Mayor would not
seek to magnify his office; it would be safer to allow the Commune to go on quietly,
so as to accustom the King to its existence. This, I take it, was the policy of
Henry FitzAylwin, the first Mayor, during his three-and-twenty years’ tenure
of office.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the duties and the authority of the Guild Merchant
were at once transferred to the Mayor and his Council. But what were the duties
of that body? What were its powers? What were its limits? In order to show
the uncertainty on this subject, remember that when Walter Hervey was Mayor
he gave Charters to certain trades. It was not contended that the Mayor had no
right to grant Charters, but that these Charters had no effect after his Mayoralty
came to an end. The powers of the Mayor were as yet uncertain; it was not
thought desirable to limit or to define them too closely. Therefore the right of the
Mayor to grant Charters was not questioned. At the same time, it was no doubt
felt, and quite rightly, that for any one Mayor to grant Charters without consulting
the Aldermen and the more “discreet” citizens might impose intolerable mischiefs
upon the City.</p>

<p>Yet, a hundred years later, we find the trades drawing up ordinances for the
regulation of their own crafts, and praying that they might be accepted and placed
under the protection of the Mayor and Aldermen. In the meantime, it is obvious,
the power and the authority of the Mayor had been more clearly defined. The
statutes placed under his protection were also placed under the protection of the
Court of Aldermen.</p>

<p>One more point to illustrate the uncertainty introduced by the new order. In
the year 1200, according to the book which will form the text of this chapter, a
Council of twenty-five “of the more discreet men of the City” were sworn to assist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the Mayor. Round, as we have seen (p. 18), shows that the number was not
twenty-five, but twenty-four; he has discovered their oath, which did not in any
way resemble the oath of an Alderman; and he has adduced other instances of
such a Council. So that there can be no doubt whatever as to its existence. Now
in the same book, which records its creation and carries the chronicle of the City
down to the year 1273, there is not a single word said about this Council. We
hear of the Aldermen, the more discreet citizens, and the principal citizens.
But not one word about the Council. Either, therefore, which one can hardly
believe, the Council was allowed to drop out of existence, or, which is much more
likely, it was a purely civic body, not recognised by the Charters and with no legal
powers; a body which acquired its importance from the Mayor of the year, and
was more in evidence a kind of private advisory committee with which the
Mayor could take counsel if he wished, or which he could neglect if he wished.</p>

<p>The book, which I have called the Text-book of the present chapter, is the
Chronicle printed by the Camden Society from the <cite>Liber de Antiquis Legibus</cite>, by
Arnold FitzThedmar. This book is, of all the mediæval documents connected with
the history of London, perhaps the most important. For it is the work of a contemporary,
one who took part in the events which he describes, a strong partisan
yet fair to his enemies; evidently a man of the highest honour and principle, and as
much a condemner of the common people as any old Tory of 1832.</p>

<p>His family history shows the ease with which foreigners were admitted in the
twelfth century to reside in, to trade in, and to become citizens of, the City of
London.</p>

<p>His grandfather, named Arnald, or Arnold, or Arnulf, was a merchant of
Cologne. He married one Ode, of the same town, with whom he lived for some
years without children. Hearing, however, of the miracles performed daily by
St. Thomas à Becket, the pair crossed the seas and made a pilgrimage to the shrine
at Canterbury, imploring the favour of the Saint in the matter of offspring. This
done, they went on to visit the famous City of London. Here the wife found that
St. Thomas had heard, and had granted her prayers. The pair accordingly
remained in London until the child was born. Then they bought a house and
remained altogether in London. They had eleven children, of whom six died
young. One of the surviving daughters was Juliana, who married a native of
Bremen, also a resident merchant in London. The youngest son, Arnold, was the
author of the Chronicle before us. A miraculous dream, he proudly tells us,
accompanied his birth. Most mediæval families were able to point with pride
to miraculous interpositions and dreams. In this case, as Arnold himself says,
the difference between the log of wood and the slab of marble which formed the
dream was known to God only. And so we may leave it.</p>

<p>Arnold became a man of considerable wealth. He was an Alderman, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the City was fined 20,000 marks by Henry and 1000 marks for his brother, Richard
of Almaine, his tallage amounted to 132 marks, or nearly a hundred and fifth
part of the whole. The way of assessment was as follows:—He first paid four
marks and forty pence for his house; then 20 marks “by inquisition of his
neighbours”; then an increase of five marks; after that an assessment of 100
marks in a lump sum by John Waleran, Constable of the Tower, and William
Hazelbech, commissioner, for the assessment appointed by the King. After that,
half a mark, and then fifteen shillings on his rent. From this assessment it appears
that the principal part of the fine must have been paid by the wealthy sort. Arnold
had a good deal of trouble over the business, being annoyed by Walter Hervey
and by Henry Waleys in succession for not having paid enough. However, he
obtained protection from King Henry first and King Edward next.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to show, from Arnold’s book, the “uncertain steps” of the
City during the century of the new order.</p>

<p>The office of Alderman was passing out of the hereditary stage; there was a
strong sense among the people that the City offices were to be held during good
conduct only. Thus, in 1216, Jacob Alderman (had he no other designation either
of trade or of birth?), being Mayor, was turned out by the King and another Mayor
appointed. We have seen that in 1233 Symon FitzMary was turned out of his
Shrievalty for wasting the City property. In 1248 the same citizen was deprived
of his Aldermanry for siding with Margery Vyel. In 1254, on account of the
escape of a criminal, the Sheriffs were deprived of office. In 1257 eight of the
Aldermen were deposed for alleged malpractices.</p>

<p>The list of sixty-two names given in Appendix III. rescues from oblivion
almost as many Aldermen of the thirteenth century. If we look into the names we
can pick out with some degree of certainty those which belong to the aristocratic
party, including the old City families and some of those which had become
naturalised. Thus, we have Aswy, Basing, Blunt, Bukerel, Farndon, or
Farringdon, Fulk, Gisors, Hardel, Haverhill, de Lisle, Renger, Sperling,
Rokesley, Tovy, Tidmar (one Arnold FitzThedmar), Vyel, etc., about one-third
of the whole.</p>

<p>We then find certain names without surnames at all, such as Adrian, Edmund,
Geoffrey, Matthew; we are surely justified in concluding that they belonged to
crafts; names such as FitzMary and FitzAlice, which indicate a mother but not a
father; names where the father’s is also a Christian name, as Thomas FitzThomas,
who, we know from FitzThedmar, belonged to the popular party; names of trades,
as Cordwainer, Ferrun, and Potter. These may all be assigned to the popular
party, and they account for nearly another third. There remain about twenty-five
names which are local, as William de Hereford, of whom it is difficult to pronounce
with any certainty. It is, however, certain that in the thirteenth century a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
deal had been already effected in the breaking down of the oligarchy and the
entrance upon office of the popular side.</p>

<div class="caption"> RICHARD II. AND HIS PATRON SAINTS<br />
From the Arundel Society’s reproduction of a contemporary painting at Walton House.</div>
</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that Henry throughout his whole reign was bitterly
hostile to the City. On the other hand, the City, it must be acknowledged, with its
turbulence and its claims of privilege and liberty, gave a despotic monarch a great
deal of annoyance. Henry’s principal weapon of retaliation was to take the City
into his own hands, <i>i.e.</i> to depose Mayor and Sheriffs, to deprive the Aldermen of
their powers, and to appoint a Warden. In 1245, on a charge of harbouring a
traitor, Henry took over the City, restoring the Charter after inflicting a fine of
£1000. In 1247, during the famous case of Margery Vyel, the King again took the
City into his own hands (see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). Also in 1249, after the tumult of the populace
against the Abbot of Westminster; in 1254, on the plea of mal-observance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
assize of bread, really in consequence of the quarrel between Richard of Almaine
and the City; in 1259, when the City refused to pay the “Queen’s Gold”; in 1257,
when the “Green” roll gave an occasion to make inquisition into the tallages;
in 1263, after the Battle of Evesham; in 1265, the reason not stated; in 1266,
after Gloucester had held the City. This is a considerable list of offences and
punishments.</p>

<p>As regards the election to the City offices, there was a great deal of uncertainty
with many changes. In 1265 only one Sheriff was allowed. In 1267 the City
was ordered to elect, and to present to the King, six persons, from whom the King
would choose two for Sheriffs.</p>

<p>The Folk Mote was used throughout this period as a weapon against the
aristocratic party. The popular leaders, William Longbeard, Thomas FitzThomas,
Walter Hervey, all made use of the Folk Mote. The King made use of it, notably
after the Green Roll business, when he sent Maunsell to persuade the people as he
pleased. It was at a Folk Mote in 1241, and at another in 1259, that the King
took formal leave of the City before going to Gascony. It was charged against
Thomas FitzThomas that he pampered the people, calling them the “Commons of
the City,” calling them together at Folk Mote asking them what was their will
without consulting the Aldermen at all. So that the people leagued themselves
together, broke into the houses of usurers, removed encroachments, threw open
rights of way; and in many other ways showed a rude, but resolute, desire to obtain
justice. Again, in 1271, on the disputed election of Walter Hervey, the people
raised the cry, “We are the Commons of the City. To us belongs the election of
the Mayor.”</p>

<p>With all this apparent tyranny, it is quite certain that the King always
recognised the importance of London. He stood by the City in their determination
not to allow the Thames fisheries to be ruined; he granted their very reasonable
request that Jews, “held in warranty by Writ of Exchequer,” should plead before
citizens as to tenements in London, and that Jewish “cheirographs,” <i>i.e.</i> keepers of
“starrs,” or deeds and covenants of Jews, should be tallaged like any other people.
His brother Richard, although continually at variance with the City, wrote a most
friendly and interesting letter on his reception in Germany. When the King
introduced his new gold coinage, he took the advice of the City on the measure, and
because they were opposed to it, he made it optional whether the people took the
gold coinage or not. He granted the prayer of the City that pleas of the citizens
relating to debt should be heard in the City only and before the Sheriffs. In 1268,
when the King granted to his son Edward customs on everything that came into
England or went out, and Edward had leased the grant to certain Italians, the City
petitioned the Prince against a continuance of this burden. The Prince resigned
the privilege, and so eased the City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>A great deal more might be extracted from this short chronicle. Enough,
however, has been taken to show the uncertainty of the City during the first century
of the new order: the people always ready to assert their rights, fancied or real, as
the Commons; the Aldermen standing, as a rule, for the old rights; the King
taking offence, often, one acknowledges, deservedly, and revenging himself by
taking the City into his own hands, by fines, by depositions, by refusals to receive
Mayor or Sheriffs; nothing settled as to the rights and methods of procedure in
elections, or in continuance of office, or in the power and authority of the Mayor,
while of the new Council of twenty-four, as I have said, not one single word.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we shall have to consider the City under its new form of
government, after the powers of the various offices have been defined and the
manner of election has been settled.</p>

<small>AFTER THE COMMUNE</small></h3>


<p>In the year of our Lord 1419, John Carpenter completed his great work on the
temporal government of the City of London, the <cite>Liber Albus</cite>. It is in this work
that we find the only complete description of the administration of the City as it
was at the beginning of the fifteenth century, with all the officers, their duties, and
their responsibilities, and the laws which governed the citizens.</p>

<p>The author was Town Clerk from the year 1417 to 1438. He was twice
Member of Parliament for the City; he was executor to Whittington; and he was
buried in the Church of St. Peter, Cornhill.</p>

<p>The book itself, and a copy made in 1582, are preserved in the Crypt of the
Guildhall. Riley, who looked through the copy, says that it abounds in errors
which have never been corrected. His own translation was made from the
original, which has long since lost the purity of aspect from which it derives its title.
Some one has written on the cover the following Latin lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Qui ‘Liber Albus’ erat, nunc est contrarius albo,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Factus et est unctis pollicibusque niger.</div>

   <div class="verse indent2">Ne, semel amisso, postea nullus erit.</div>
   <div class="verse">Quod si nullus erit—nonnulla est nostraque culpa—</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Hei! pretii summi, perdita gemma, Vale!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The design of the work is thus laid down by John Carpenter himself:—</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as the fallibility of human memory and the shortness of life
do not allow us to gain an accurate knowledge of everything that deserves
remembrance, even though the same may have been committed to writing, more
especially, if it has been so committed without order or arrangement, and still
more so, when no such written account exists; seeing, too, that when, as not
unfrequently happens, all the aged, most experienced, and most discreet rulers of
the Royal City of London have been carried off at the same instance, as it were,
by pestilence, younger persons who have succeeded them in the government of the
City have, on various occasions, been often at a loss from the very want of such
written information; the result of which has repeatedly been disputes and perplexity
among them as to the decisions which they should give; it has long been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
deemed necessary, as well by the superior authorities of the said City as by those of
subordinate rank, that a volume—from the fact of its containing the regulations of
the City, it might be designated a ‘Repertory’—should be compiled from the more
noteworthy memoranda that lie scattered without order or classification throughout
the books and rolls, as well as the Charters of
the said City. And forasmuch as such design—for
some cause unknown, unless, indeed, it be
the extreme laboriousness of the undertaking—has
not been heretofore carried into effect, a
volume of this nature, by favour of our Lord,
is now at length compiled, in the Mayoralty of
that illustrious man, Richard Whityngton, Mayor
of the said City; that is to say, in the month of
November, in the year of our Lord’s Incarnation
one thousand four hundred and nineteen, being
the seventh year of the reign of King Henry, the
fifth of that name since the Conquest; containing
therein not only those laudable observances, which,
though not written, have been usually followed and
approved in the said City, to the end that they
may not be lost in oblivion hereafter, but also
those noteworthy memoranda which have been
committed to writing, but lie scattered in disorder
in manner before mentioned; that so, by their
being ascertained, the superior authorities of the
said City, as well as those of subordinate rank, may
know henceforth with greater accuracy what in
rare and unusual emergencies should be done.”</p>

<p>I purpose in this chapter to make such extracts,
quotations, and abridgments from the book
as shall serve to explain in general terms, avoiding
the minute details with which the book is crowded, the nature of the government
of the City in the time of Whittington.</p>

<p>The author treats first of the offices of Mayor, Alderman, and Sheriff. The
office of Mayor, he says, ignoring the subtleties of shire law and commune, was
originally called Portgrave or Portreeve; he was the King’s representative in the
City, Escheator, Chamberlain, and Justiciar, as well as Portreeve. By the Charter
of Henry III., the Barons of the City<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> were confirmed in the Privilege of electing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
their own Mayor every year. The election of the Mayor was an event greatly
feared on account of the danger of a riot if the people were allowed to rush
tumultuously into the Guildhall. A custom grew up, therefore, for the Mayor,
Aldermen, and Sheriffs to meet together some days before the election, and so
order things as to meet the danger. They therefore selected certain discreet
citizens, so many from each ward, and summoned them by name to be present at
the election on the Day of St. Edward, King and Confessor, and on that day no
one was allowed in the Guildhall who had not been summoned.</p>

</div>

<p>Disputes arose between the Aldermen and the commoners thus selected,
the latter claiming the nomination of the Mayor. The Aldermen, however, refused
to allow this claim, on the ground that they, too, were citizens, and therefore
entitled to vote. They therefore arrived at a compromise by which the commoners,
one end of the Hall, nominated two Aldermen who had already served as Sheriffs,
and presented their names to the Mayor and Aldermen at the other end, who
proceeded to elect one of them.</p>

<p>In the early years of the Mayoralty the same Mayor was often re-elected; the
reason why this custom obtained, was that at first the office brought with it no
expenses; when, however, the Mayor had to give liveries, to conduct ridings, to
maintain servants, and to hold feasts, the expense was generally too great
for one man to support for more than a year. When the practice had
become common for the Mayor to retire after one year, then, and not till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
then, the Aldermen went through the form of offering him a second term as
a compliment.</p>

<p>“The feast of the Apostles Simon and Jude being now come, about the tenth
hour by the clock, it was the custom for the Mayor, all the Aldermen—arrayed in
cloaks of violet,—and numerous commoners, to meet together at the Guildhall.
Silence and attention being then enjoined by the Common Crier, in other words,
the Serjeant-at-arms, and duly made, the Recorder, seated at the right hand of the
Mayor, announced to the people that, in conformity with the ancient usage of the
City, upon that day he who was to be Mayor for the then ensuing year was to take
the oath. Then it was the custom also for him to compliment the outgoing Mayor
upon such points as deserved commendation; and the Mayor, too, if he had anything
to say, was duly heard. This done, the outgoing Mayor vacated his seat, and the
Mayor-elect took his place; the past Mayor, however, sitting next to him, on his
left hand. Then the Common Serjeant-at-arms, holding before him the book with
the Kalendar, with the effigy of Him crucified on the outside thereof, and he in the
meantime placing his hand upon the book, the Common Clerk read to him the oath
that he was about to make on the morrow in the King’s Exchequer. When
he had made the promise and duly kissed the book, the old Mayor delivered to
him the Seal of the Statute Merchant, together with the Seal of the Mayoralty,
enclosed in two purses. The new Mayor was also heard, if he had anything to
say, by way of entreating the aid of his fellow-Aldermen during his time, as
also the Sheriffs and substantial men of the community, for the better government
of the City.”</p>

<p>On the day after, the Mayor took the oath at the Exchequer:—</p>

<p>“On the morrow of the Feast of the Apostles Simon and Jude, provided such
day was not Sunday—in which case the ensuing Monday was substituted,—it was
the custom for both the new and the past Mayor, and the Aldermen as well, in a
like suit of robes, attended by the Sheriffs, and as many as were of the Mayor’s
livery and of the several mysteries, arrayed in their respective suits, to meet on
horseback upon the place without the Guildhall about nine by the clock, the sword
being borne upright before the person nominated as Mayor. Departing thence,
they rode together along Chepe, through the gate of Newgate, and then, turning
into Flete-street, passed on to Westminster.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival there, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs alighted from
their horses, and, preceded by the mace-bearers and Mayor’s sword-bearer, ascended
to the room of the Exchequer, where were the Chancellor, Treasurer, Keeper of
the King’s Privy Seal, and Barons of the Exchequer. The Mayor, Aldermen, and
Sheriffs then standing at the Bar, the Recorder stated how that the City of London,
in accordance with its ancient customs and liberties, had chosen N. as Mayor for
the year then next ensuing, requesting the Barons, on behalf of the City, to accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the individual so elected, who then and there appeared in person. Answer being
made by the chief Baron, or his representative, that it was their pleasure so to do,
the book was presented to the Mayor, placing his hand upon which, he was charged
with the same oath that he had made at the Guildhall.”</p>

<p>This oath is given in full in <cite>Liber Albus</cite>, and we may compare it with that
of an Alderman on p. 78.</p>

<p>“You shall swear, that well and lawfully you shall serve our lord the King in
the office of the Mayoralty in the City of London, and the same City you shall
surely and safely keep to the behoof of the King of England, and of his heirs,
Kings of England; and the profit of the King you shall do in all things that unto
you belong to do, and the rights of the King, in so far as unto the Crown they
belong within the said City, you shall lawfully keep. You shall not assent unto the
decrease, or unto the concealment of the rights or of the franchises of the King;
and where you shall know the rights of the King or of the Crown, be it in lands, or
in rents, or in franchises, or in suits, to be concealed or withdrawn, to your utmost
power you shall do to repel it; and if you cannot do it, you shall tell it unto the
King, or unto them of his Council, of whom you shall be certain that they will tell
it unto the King. And that lawfully and rightfully you will treat the people of your
bailiwick, and right will do unto every one thereof, as well unto strangers as to
denizens, to poor as to rich, in that which belongeth unto you to do; and that
neither for highness, nor for riches, nor for promise, nor for favour, nor for hate,
wrong you shall do unto any one; nor the right of any one shall you disturb, nor
shall you take anything whereby the King may lose, or by which his right may
be disturbed. And that in all things which unto the Mayor of the said City it
pertaineth to do, as well in the regulation of victuals as in all other things, well and
lawfully you shall behave yourself.—So God you help, and the Saints.”</p>

<p>This done, it was the custom for the chief Baron of the Exchequer, on behalf
of the King and the Lords, to charge the Mayor in especial to preserve peace and
tranquillity in the said City; and then, to the best of his ability, so to exercise
surveillance over the sellers of all kinds of provisions, as not to allow the public to
suffer from excessive prices. And after this, it was the usage for the late Mayor
there to present himself as ready to account for his office as Escheator; whereupon
he also was sworn to render a good and faithful account of the said office, appointing
there such person as he might think proper to act as his attorney in passing his
accounts.</p>

<p>The Mayor also and Aldermen, in behalf of the City, appointed a member of
the Exchequer as attorney of the said City, to challenge and claim their liberties, as
and when necessity might demand; after which, upon receiving leave from their
lordships, they withdrew. In like manner also, in the Common Bench, they
appointed a member of that place to act as attorney for the City. But in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
King’s Bench it was the custom for them to appoint two attorneys, jointly and
severally, to claim the liberties and ancient customs of the said City, as and when
necessity might demand. Which done, they returned, the commons preceding on
horseback in companies, arrayed in the suits of their respective mysteries. Those,
however, who were members of the mystery to which the Mayor belonged, as also
those who were of his livery, proceeded next before the Mayor. No person,
however, moved so close to the Mayor but that there was a marked space between,
while the serjeants-at-arms, the mace-bearers, and his sword-bearer, went before
him, with one Sheriff on his right hand, and the other
on his left, bearing white wands in their hands. The
Recorder and the other Aldermen followed next in
order, and accompanied him through the middle of the
market of Westchepe to his house, after which they
returned home, as many, that is, as had not been
invited to the feast.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig-15"></a>
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CROSSBOWMAN</div>
</div>

<p>On the same day, after dinner, it was the custom
for the new Mayor to proceed from his house to the
Church of Saint Thomas de Acon, those of his livery
preceding him; and after the Aldermen had there
assembled, they then proceeded together to the Church
of Saint Paul. Upon arriving there, at a spot, namely,
in the middle of the nave of the Church, between the
two small doors, it was the custom to pray for the soul
of Bishop William, who, by his entreaties, it is said,
obtained from his lordship, William the Conqueror,
great liberties for the City of London; the priest
repeating the <i lang="la">De Profundis</i>. They then moved on to the churchyard, where
lie the bodies of the parents of Thomas, late Archbishop of Canterbury; and
there they also repeated the <i lang="la">De Profundis</i>, etc., in behalf of all the faithful of
God departed, near the grave of his parents before mentioned. After this, they
returned through the market of Chepe (sometimes with lighted torches, if it was
late) to the said Church of Saint Thomas, and there the Mayor and Aldermen made
an offering of one penny each; which done, every one returned to his home, and
the morning and the evening were one day.</p>

<p>We come next to the office of Alderman. The Aldermen had of old not only
the style and title of Barons, but were buried with baronial honours:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>“For in the church where the Alderman was about to be buried, a person
appeared upon a caparisoned horse, arrayed in the armour of the deceased, bearing
a banner in his hand, and carrying upon him the shield, helmet, and the rest of his
arms, along with the banner, as is still the usage at the sepulture of lords of
baronial rank. But by reason of the sudden and frequent changes of the Aldermen,
and the repeated occurrence of pestilence, this ceremonial in London gradually died
out and disappeared. From this, however, it is evident what high honour was paid
to the Aldermen in ancient times.”</p>

<p>The election of an Alderman was after the manner following:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is the custom for the Mayor to proceed to the Ward that is vacant, and, at the place where the
Wardmote of such Ward is usually held, to cause to be summoned before him by the bedel all the Freemen
who inhabit such Ward, should he think proper: and there forthwith, if they are willing and able, or else
on a given day, the Alderman is to be elected by the greater and more substantial portion of them,
provided always, that fifteen days do not expire before making such election; for in such case, the Mayor
is bound, and has been wont, with the counsel of his fellow-Aldermen, to appoint some man who is honest,
rich, and circumspect, to be Alderman of such Ward. It is the duty also of the men of such Ward, when
they have made their election, in manner already stated, to present the person so elected to the Mayor and
Aldermen for admission.</p>

<p>And if the person elected, after he has been admitted, shall refuse to accept or undertake such
charge, by custom of the City he shall lose his freedom; and he is not to be readmitted to the same without
making a notable fine and ransom. But if the person so elected is duly admitted, in such case he
shall take the oath that is entered in the Second Part of Book III. of the present volume, folio 125;
provided always, that if the Mayor and Aldermen, for some notable cause, shall not think proper to admit
the person elected, the Ward shall proceed again to make a more suitable election. But if the Wardsmen
shall refuse to do this, or if, from malevolence and pride of heart, they shall elect some other person whom
the Court, taking into consideration the advantage and honour of the City, cannot so far demean itself as
to accept, it is the usage for the Mayor and Aldermen, as in the former case, after waiting fifteen days, to
elect and admit another.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, pp. 35-36.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the form of oath taken by the newly elected Alderman:—</p>

<p>“You shall swear, that well and lawfully you shall serve our lord the King in
the City of London, in the office of Alderman in the Ward of N, wherein you
are chosen Alderman, and shall lawfully treat and inform the people of the same
Ward of such things as unto them pertain to do, for keeping the City, and for maintaining
the peace within the City; and that the laws, usages, and franchises of the
said City you shall keep and maintain, within town and without, according to your
wit and power. And that attentive you shall be to save and maintain the rights of
orphans, according to the laws and usages of the said City. And that ready you
shall be, and readily shall come, at the summons and warning of the Mayor and
ministers of the said City, for the time being, to speed the Assizes, Pleas, and Judgments
of the Hustings, and other needs of the said City, if you be not hindered
by the needs of our lord the King, or by other reasonable cause; and that good
lawful counsel you shall give for such things as touch the common profit in the same
City. And that you shall sell no manner of victuals by retail; that is to say, bread,
ale, wine, fish or flesh, by you, your apprentices, hired persons, servants, or by any
other; nor profit shall you take of any such manner of victuals sold during your
office. And that well and lawfully you shall (behave) yourself in the said office, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
in other things touching the City.—So God you help, and the Saints.” (<cite>Liber
Albus</cite>, p. 267.)</p>

<p>Formerly, says the author, the wards were called after their Aldermen, as the
Ward of Anketill de Auvern, the Ward of Henry le Frowyk, and others; but
afterwards the Aldermen were called after their wards.</p>

<p>The person of the Alderman was sacred. If a man struck an Alderman he had
his hand struck off; if he defamed an Alderman he was pilloried and imprisoned.</p>

<p>The Alderman held his office for life. He was the magistrate, almost despotic,
of his own ward; he had his officers or serjeants to attend him; and he presided at
the Court called the Ward Mote, by which inquiry was made into the condition of
the ward.</p>

<p>The Sheriffs were elected on the Day of St. Matthew, the 21st of September.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As concerning the election of sheriffs,—the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen and Commons, are to be
assembled on the day of Saint Matthew the Apostle [September 21], in such manner as is ordained on the
election of the Mayor; and in the first place, the Mayor shall choose of his own free will, a reputable man,
free of the City, to be one of the Sheriffs for the ensuing year; for whom he is willing to answer as to
one-half of the ferm of the City due to the King, if he who is so elected by the Mayor shall prove not
sufficient. But if the Mayor elect him by counsel and with the assent of the Aldermen, they also ought to
be answerable with him. And those who are elected for the Common Council, themselves, and the others
summoned by the Mayor for this purpose, as before declared, shall choose another Sheriff, for the
commonalty; for whom all the commonalty is bound to be answerable as to the other half of the ferm so
due to the King, in case he shall prove not sufficient. And if any controversy arise between the commons
as to the election, the matter is to proceed and be discussed in such manner as is contained in the article
upon the ‘Common Council’ in the 13th Chapter of this First Book.</p>

<p>And if any one of those then chosen to be Sheriffs shall refuse or absent himself, so as not to be
ready at the Guildhall in the Vigil of Saint Michael next ensuing, at ten by the clock, there to receive his
charge, there shall be levied forthwith from the goods, lands, and tenements of him who so absents himself,
one hundred pounds; one-half to the use of the Chamber, and the other half to the use of him
who shall be then suddenly elected and charged by reason of such default. And if the second person
elected shall refuse the charge, all his goods, lands, and tenements, shall be arrested, for all expenses
touching that office.</p>

<p>And the old Sheriffs shall come to the Guildhall, at eleven by the clock at the very latest, and shall
deliver to the Mayor (at the latest, at the Mayor’s general Court that is held after the Feast of the
Epiphany) all records of pleas touching freeholds pleaded before them in their time, with all other
memoranda touching recoveries suffered by any person, under a penalty of one hundred shillings, to be
levied from each of them and to be paid to the use of the Chamber. To do which, the Mayor shall warn
them the day on which they shall receive their charge. And then the Mayor shall deliver the Cocket<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> to
such Sheriff as he himself shall have chosen, and the records to the Chamberlain for safe custody.” (<cite>Liber
Albus</cite>, Riley’s translation, pp. 39-40.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was the oath of the Sheriffs:—</p>

<p>“You shall swear, that you shall be good and true unto N, the King of
England, and his heirs, and the franchise of the City of London you shall save and
maintain, within the City and without, according to your power; and that well and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
lawfully you shall keep the Counties of London and of Middlesex, and the offices
which unto the same Counties appertain to be done, well and lawfully you shall do,
according to your wit and power; and that right you shall do as well to poor as to
rich; and that no good custom you shall break, or evil one maintain. And that the
assizes of bread, and of ale, and all other assizes which unto you pertain, within the
franchise of the City and without, well and lawfully you shall keep and shall cause to
be kept. And that the judgments and executions of your Court you shall not delay
without reasonable cause, nor any right disturb; and that the Writs which unto you
shall come, touching the state and the franchise of the City, you shall not return
before you have shown them unto the Mayor, for the time being, and unto the
Council of the City, and of them have advice. And that ready you shall be, at
reasonable warning of the Mayor, for keeping and maintaining the peace and state
of the City. And that all other things which pertain unto your office and the
keeping of the said Counties, lawfully you shall do, by you and yours, and the said
City shall keep from harm, according to your wit and power. And that the County
of Middlesex or the keeping of the Gaol of Newgate you shall not let to ferm.—So
God you help, and the Saints.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, pp. 266-267.)</p>

<p>When the Sheriffs were sworn all their servants had to take oath: their
serjeants, clerks, valets, bailiffs of the customs and of Middlesex, and the gaoler of
Newgate and his clerk; and the same day the Sheriffs were to go to Newgate and
to take over the prisoners there; observe, by the terms of their oath, that they were
not allowed to let the gaol “to ferm” nor the County of Middlesex.</p>

<p>Other officers were the Recorder, who was to be, on appointment, a barrister of
less than sixteen years’ standing, the Chamberlain, the Common Serjeant-at-Law,
and the Common Clerk. And there were inferior officers, clerks and serjeants.</p>

<p>Leaving the officers, John Carpenter goes on to show how the Barons and the
community must behave towards the King and his Justiciars: in other words, he
speaks of the method of receiving the King’s Writs and the Pleading of the Pleas of
the Crown. Let us pass over these points, which are curious to the antiquary, and
come to the methods of hearing criminal cases:—</p>

<p>“It is to be observed that, in accordance with the ancient liberties and customs
of the City of London, there are three purgations in Pleas of the King’s Crown, by
means whereof persons appealed, charged, and accused, are in duty bound to acquit
themselves. The first of these is employed in cases of homicide or murder; such
purgation being called the ‘Great Law.’ The second kind of purgation bears reference
to mayhem, and is known as the ‘Middle Law.’ The third purgation is
employed in cases of assault, battery, rapine, wounding, blows, bloodshed, and other
injuries of a like nature, inflicted at the season of Our Lord’s Nativity and in the
weeks of Easter and Pentecost; such purgation being styled the ‘Third Law.’</p>

<p>When a person is bound to clear himself by the Great Law, the mode of pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>ceeding
according to such law is as follows:—He who is so appealed, charged and
accused, has to make oath in his own behalf six times, in his own proper person;
to the effect, that is to say, on each occasion, that he is innocent and guiltless of
felony and breach of the peace of his lord the King, as also of all crime so laid to his
charge,—‘So God may help him and those holy Gospels.’ After this, six men are
to make oath that, to the best of their conscience and understanding, the oath that
he has so sworn is a sound oath and a safe,—‘So God may help them and those
holy Gospels.’ And this proceeding shall be repeated until the number of six-and-thirty
jurors is exhausted; due care being taken that on each occasion the person
accused makes oath first, in form before stated, and then, after him, six men, until
the number before mentioned is completed.</p>

</div>

<p>In selecting these six-and-thirty men, the procedure, according to the ancient
usage of the City of London, is wont to be, and should be, as follows:—The person
accused being absent, eighteen men must be chosen from the East side of
Walebroke and eighteen men from the West side of Walebroke, persons who are
not kinsmen, cousins, or members of the family of the accused, nor yet connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
with him by marriage or in any other way, but only trustworthy men of the franchise
of the City. The names of these persons are to be read to the accused; who, upon
hearing them, shall show unto the Mayors and Barons of the City the names of such
among them as he holds suspected. And if he shall show reasonable cause against
them, the names of such persons shall be struck out of the written list, and others
shall be chosen in their stead, to complete the aforesaid number and duly to be read
before him. And when the accused shall be content with the names so entered, and
shall have put himself upon them for clearing himself of the said accusation, then, by
counsel of the City, he shall appear before the Justiciars of his lordship the King, at
a certain time and place, to wage and make his law. But in accordance with the
ancient usage of the City, such person shall have respite for making his law for a
term of forty days at the least complete. And the names of the six-and-thirty men
so chosen shall be delivered unto the Justiciars of his lordship the King.</p>

<p>In making the Middle Law, the procedure is as follows:—The person, namely,
who is charged and appealed of mayhem has to take oath in his own behalf three
times, in his own proper person; to the effect, that is to say, on each occasion, that
he is innocent and guiltless of that felony, and of breach of the peace of his lord the
King, as also of all crime so laid to his charge,—‘So God may help him and those
holy Gospels.’ After him also, six men are to make oath that the oath that he has
so sworn is a lawful oath and a safe, to the best of their conscience and understanding,—‘So
God may help them and the holy Gospels.’ And this proceeding
shall be repeated until the number of eighteen jurors is exhausted; due care being
taken that on each occasion the person accused makes oath first, in form before
stated, and then, after him, six men, until the number before mentioned is completed.</p>

<p>In selecting such eighteen men, the same procedure is to be observed as is set
forth above in all matters relating to the Great Law before mentioned.</p>

<p>In making the Third Law, the procedure is as follows:—A person accused of
assault, battery, rapine, wounding, blows, bloodshed, and other injuries of a like
nature, inflicted at the holy seasons before named, has to make oath once in his own
behalf, in his own proper person; to the effect that he is innocent and guiltless of
the misdeed laid to his charge, and of breach of the peace of his lord the King at the
holy seasons above mentioned,—‘So God may help him and those holy Gospels.’
After him also, six men are to make oath that the oath that he has so sworn is a
lawful oath and a safe, to the best of their conscience and understanding,—‘So God
may help them and those holy Gospels.’ And be it known, that these six men
should be chosen of the venue in which the person so accused is dwelling; provided
always, that they are not cousins, or kinsmen, or members of his family, nor yet connected
with him by marriage, or in any other way, but only trustworthy men of that
venue and of the franchise of the City. And the names of such persons shall be
read to the accused, etc., as above stated under the Great Law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>The old custom of holding the Folk Mote was still kept up though the
Common Council now performed its most important functions:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There are three principal Folkmotes in the year. One is at the feast of Saint Michael, to know
who shall be Sheriff, and to hear the charges given. The second is at Christmas, to arrange the Wards.
The third is at the feast of Saint John (24th June), to protect the City from fire, by reason of the great
drought. If any man of London neglects to attend at one of these three Folkmotes, he is to forfeit forty
shillings to the King. But, by the Law of London, the Sheriff ought to enquire after him whom he shall
think proper, that is to say, whether he is there or not. And if there be any one who is not there, and he
is there enquired after, such person ought to be summoned to the Hustings, if he is bound to abide by the
law of the city. If the good man says that he was not summoned, the same must be known through the
bedel of the Ward. If the bedel says at the Hustings that he was summoned, even where it is proved
that the bedel has no other witness, no witness needs he have, save the great bell that is rung for the
Folkmote at St. Paul’s.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The most important Court was that called the Hustings:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Be it made known, that all lands, and tenements, rents and services, within the City of London
and the suburbs thereof, are pleadable at the Guildhall in the same city, at the two Hustings; of which
the one Hustings is called ‘Hustings of Pleas of Land,’ and the other Hustings is called ‘Hustings of
Common Pleas’; which Hustings are holden in the said Guildhall, before the Mayor and Sheriffs of the
same city, upon the Monday and Tuesday in each week; that is to say, upon Monday, for demanding
appearance of demandants, and for the award of nonsuits, and the allowing of essoins; and upon Tuesday,
for the award of defaults, and for pleading—certain seasons and Feast-days excepted, as well as other
reasonable causes; at which times no Hustings can be held, by usage of the city aforesaid. It should also
be known, that the Hustings of Pleas of Land must be held one week apart by itself, and that of Common
Pleas the next week apart by itself, upon the days aforesaid; but the enrolments and titles of the said
Hustings make mention of Monday only.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. R. Sharpe’s Introduction to his <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> for the
following additional notes on the “Court of Husting.” (1) To begin with, it was
the single institution which the Saxon borrowed from the Dane. “Husting” =
Hus-thing, the cause or case pleaded in the House, instead of in the open air.</p>

<p>The Court of Husting is mentioned in the Laws of Edward the Confessor as
the place where the Court of the King is held every Monday. It is the oldest
Court of record in the City, and at one time constituted the sole court for settling
disputes between citizen and citizen. After the establishment of the Mayor’s and
Sheriff’s Court for the settlement of actions merely personal, all actions affecting
laws were heard in the Court of Husting. It was a Court of appeal for the Sheriff’s
Court, while appeal from the decisions might be heard by certain commissioners at
St. Martin-le-Grand. There was, after this, final appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The Court sat for a long time on Monday only. Thus it became the custom to
sit on Monday for purposes of demanding the appearance of defendants, the award
of nonsuits and the allowing of essoins, <i>i.e.</i> excuses for non-appearance. The
sitting of Tuesday was for the award of defaults and for pleading. Eventually the
Monday sitting was discontinued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>During the fairs of Boston and Winchester, and during harvest-time, the Court
did not sit.</p>

<p>The judges in the Court of Husting were the Mayor and Sheriffs, the Recorder
sitting as assessor for the examination of witnesses and for preliminary judgment.
As the Court could not be held in the absence of the Mayor, and great inconvenience
was sometimes so caused, an Act was passed in 1584 providing that, if the
Lord Mayor was prevented from attending by sickness, any Alderman who had
passed the Chair might act for him. But as early as the thirteenth century it had
become a custom for any Aldermen to be present in the Husting and to act as
Judges.</p>

<p>It was the custom for the officer who summoned the Aldermen to the Court to
show his respect for them and for the Court by riding a horse valued at a hundred
shillings at least.</p>

<p>The Town Clerk was Registrar.</p>

<p>The Counsel employed in the Court were the four City pleaders; the attorneys
were those of the Mayor’s clerk.</p>

<p>The reader is referred to Dr. Sharpe’s pages for details of the Common Pleas
and Writs used in this Court.</p>

<p>Aliens could be admitted to the freedom of the City only by this Court.</p>

<p>Disputes as to building were decided by this Court.</p>

<p>It was even a place for public penance. Perjury was punished by imprisonment
until the next Husting, when the offender was placed upon a high stool before
all the people while his crime was read aloud. After this, he was set at liberty.</p>

<p>In this Court deeds and wills were enrolled.</p>

<p>In this Court land was conveyed by a method “described by Blackstone as a
kind of real contract, whereby the bargainer for some pecuniary consideration
bargains and sells, that is, contracts to convey the land to the bargainee, and
becomes by such bargain a trustee for, or seised to the use of the bargainee, and
then the Statute of Uses completes the purchase; in other words the bargain first
vests the use, and then the statute vests the possession.” (<cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>, i. 23.)</p>

<p>Probate of Will naturally belonged to the Court which enrolled Wills.</p>

<p>The Court undertook the guardianship of orphans. The citizen of London had
the right of devising part only of his property; a certain part of it going, with or
without his wish, to his widow and children. This restriction was only removed by
the 2nd Act of George the First. The widow, for instance, by the custom of the
City, was entitled to one-third of his estate, the children to another third, the
residue was at the free disposal of the testator and was known as the legatory or the
dead man’s portion.</p>

<p>Among the wills enrolled in the Court of Husting, Sharpe mentions the
following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1. John de Kyrkeby, Bishop of Ely, who endowed his see with houses, vines, and gardens situate
at Holborn, whose gift is remembered at the present day by the names of Ely Place, Vine Street, and
Kirby Street, and whose gardens, part and parcel of the gift, call to mind the well-known lines put into the
mouth of the Duke of Gloucester by Shakespeare (<cite>Richard III.</cite>, Act iii. sc. 4):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">‘My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,</div>
   <div class="verse">I saw good strawberries in your garden there.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. William de Farndon, Alderman of Farringdon Ward, to which he gave its name, and Nicholas [le
Fevre?], who married his daughter, took his name, and became Alderman of his Ward, which he afterwards
disposed of by will to John de Pulteneye, although the latter appears never to have been <i lang="la">de facto</i>
Alderman of the Ward.</p>

</div>

<p>3. William de Elsing, the founder of Elsing Spital, on the site of which was afterwards built Sion
College with its almhouses, one of the few picturesque relics of Old London which till lately remained to
us, but now vanished.</p>

<p>4. William Walworth, whose prowess when Mayor against the rebel Wat Tyler at Smithfield is
sufficiently well known.</p>

<p>5. Sir John Philpot, who was appointed joint treasurer with Walworth for receiving the subsidy
granted to Richard II. on his accession, and who received the honour of knighthood with Walworth,
Nicholas Brembre, and others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>
<p>6. John Northampton and Nicholas Exton, so long rivals of one another, the latter supporting
Nicholas Brembre in his endeavour to sustain the monopoly enjoyed by the free fishmongers of the City, in
opposition to the former.</p>

<p>7. Richard Whityngton, four times Mayor of London, whose munificent gifts and charitable acts
need not be recorded here, as they are already household words.</p>

<p>8. John Colet, Dean of St. Paul’s, Sir Andrew Judde, Sir Andrew Laxton, and many others whose
names are associated with the cause of education, not only within the City of London, but in all parts of
the country.</p>

<p>9. Sir Martin Bowes, the wealthy and charitable goldsmith, whose almhouses at Woolwich still bear
witness to his generosity, and who bequeathed to the Mayor of the City of London for the time being and
his successors a goodly cross of gold set with pearls and precious stones to hang at the collar of gold worn
by the Mayor at high feasts, ‘as mentioned in the Repertory.’</p>

<p>10. And, lastly, Sir Thomas Gresham (not to mention numerous others), the founder of the College
within the City which still bears his name, and to whose munificence the merchants of the City were
indebted for their first bourse, or Royal Exchange.” (<cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>, ii. 2-4.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Courts of the City, therefore, were the Folk Mote and the Court of
Husting, which gave the City a sense of unity though as yet there was no collective
governing body and no Head or Chief to stand for the City.</p>

<p>There was, next, the Ward Mote, for the local business of each ward.</p>

<p>“The Wardmote is so called as being a meeting together by summons of all
inhabitants of a Ward, in presence of its head, the Alderman, or else his deputy,
for the correction of defaults, the removal of nuisances, and the promotion of the well-being
of such Ward. The meetings that we call ‘Wardmotes,’ the Romans called
<i lang="la">plebiscita</i>; the same in fact that were styled <em>folkesmot</em> by the Saxons in ancient
times. The Aldermen were in the habit also, by virtue of warrants by the Mayor
for the time being to them directed, to hold their Wardmotes, twice at least, or
oftener, in the year; on which occasions enquiry used to be made as to the condition
and tranquillity of the Ward, and such defaults as were presented were
corrected by the Alderman, as hereafter will be shown.</p>

<p>The process of holding a Wardmote in London has customarily been as
follows:—The Alderman, after receipt of the warrant, is to command his bedel to
summon all such men as are householders, as well as all hired servants, in his Ward,
to appear before him at a certain day and hour on the morrow of such summons, in
a certain place within the same Ward, for the purpose of holding such Wardmote.
These names, after the persons have been duly summoned, the bedel is to have
entered in a certain roll, those of the freemen, namely, of the City who dwell in
that Ward, by themselves, and those of the hired servants and non-freemen, by
themselves. And when at the hour appointed they have duly met together, the
Alderman having taken his seat with the more opulent men of the Ward, each in
his proper place, the clerk of the Alderman is to enjoin the bedel, in behalf of such
Aldermen, to command attention; which done it is the clerk’s duty to read aloud
the warrant before mentioned, and then to read to the bedel the names that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
entered in the roll; while the bedel in his turn proclaims aloud that every person
who shall not, there present, answer to his name, and shall make default therein,
shall be put down and amerced in the sum of four pence at the least. After this,
the bedel is to present to the Alderman a panel, arrayed by the Constables of the
Ward, of those reputable men of such Ward by whom Inquisition should be made;
which array, if the Alderman shall deem it expedient, he shall be at liberty to
amend. This done, the jurors are to have read to them all the articles touching
such Wardmote. After this, a certain day for making their presentment is to be
given by the Alderman to the jurors. On which day the jurors are to present their
verdict indented, one part of it to remain in possession of the Alderman, and the
other with the Ward. It is the duty also of the Alderman to present his part to the
Mayor, at the sitting of his next General Court; to the end that, after it has been
seen and enquired if there is any matter the correction of which pertains unto the
Mayor and City, the aforesaid indenture may be redelivered to him, to be acted
upon in other respects, etc.</p>

<p>And at the said Wardmote, there ought to be elected by the Alderman and
reputable men of the Ward, as also by the jurors, the Scavagers, Ale-conners,
Bedel, and other officials; who, at the General Court before mentioned, shall take
the oaths befitting their respective offices. The Alderman also used to be specially
certified by the bedel as to the names of such hostelers, brewers, bakers, cooks,
victuallers, and auctioneers as dwelt within the Ward. Bakers also were to have
their stamps there, the impressions of which were to be entered upon the
Alderman’s paper; for doing which, every baker had to pay the Alderman four
pence, unless it so happened that he had previously paid for an impression being
taken of his stamp before the same Alderman of the Ward, no change of Alderman
having taken place. It was the usage also for the Aldermen to seal the measures
and weights in their respective Wards, and to condemn such as were not sealed,
receiving a remuneration for such sealing to their own proper use, in the same way
that the City Chamber now receives it. For every Ward had its own measure,
made of brass, and corresponding with the royal standard of the City. At such
Wardmote also, those persons who are not free of the City, and who have not
previously been sworn there to that effect, ought to be put upon frank-pledge, notwithstanding
that in other Wards they have been already received therein; on
which occasion they are to take the oath for persons about to be admitted to frank-pledge.
Every person also who is about to be so received is to give one penny to
the clerk for his entrance; and if any such person shall absent himself at such
Wardmote, he shall pay four pence to the Alderman; unless indeed such person be
a Knight, Esquire, female, apprentice-at-law, or clerk, or some other individual who
has not a permanent abode in this City.</p>

<p>The Alderman ought also, in his own person, to supervise and correct all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
defaults and nuisances presented by the jurors at the Wardmote aforesaid, unless
perchance any matters of difficulty should arise, and of a nature bearing reference to
the Chamber; matters of which description the Mayor and Chamberlain, aided by
the Sheriffs and other officials, shall take in hand. Also, if the Alderman shall find
the officers under him remiss or negligent, he shall warn them to amend their
conduct; which if they neglect to do, he shall reasonably punish and chastise them,
or else report the same to the Mayor, whose duty it is to provide a condign remedy
for the same.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, Riley’s translation, pp. 32-35.)</p>

<p>The Common Council—of which we have seen the beginning in the election of
the Twenty-four—was now a fully organised body with definite duties, and methods
of procedure laid down and established.</p>

<p>“The manner of holding a Common Council is as follows:—The day before the
meeting thereof, the Mayor and Aldermen are to cause summons to be made by the
serjeants of the Chamber, for sixteen, twelve, eight, or four (according as the Ward
is great or small) of the wisest and most wealthy persons of each Ward to appear on
the morrow at the Guildhall; and [further, to give notice] that no one is to appear
unless summoned, or presume to be present at such Council, under pain of imprisonment,
according to ancient usage, as also, by recent enactment, under a certain
penalty and chastisement named in an ordinance made in the Mayoralty of Nicholas
Wottone. All the commoners, too, that are summoned are to be called over one by
one, by a serjeant of the Chamber standing aloft; and as to those who make default,
they are to be noted by a clerk of the Chamber in a roll which he holds in his
hands, in which are entered the names of those who have been summoned.</p>

<p>And as to those who duly appear, they shall then form a congregation; and if
any matter of great difficulty or doubt shall arise, upon which they cannot agree,
they shall be severally examined by the Serjeant-at-Law of the Common Clerk and
of the Common Serjeant-at-Arms, upon the oath by which they are bound unto the
City, etc. And observe, that the business of the City is not to be delayed for the
arrival of the men of a Ward or two, supposing that they have been duly summoned;
but it must be proceeded with, the presence of the persons so absent not being
waited for. Every one, too, of the persons so summoned who does not appear is to
be amerced in the sum of two shillings on each occasion, etc.</p>

<p>The oath of the men elected to the Common Council is as follows:—</p>

<p>You shall swear that you shall be trusty unto our lord the King N, and unto
his heirs; and shall quickly come, when you are summoned to the Common Council
of this City, if you be not reasonably excused; and good and true counsel you shall
give, after your wit and cunning; and that for favour of any man you shall maintain
no singular profit against the public or common profit of the said City; and that
after you come to the Common Council, you shall not from thence depart, without
reasonable cause or the Mayor’s license, until the Mayor and his fellows shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
departed; and that what shall be spoken in the Common Council you shall not
disclose,—So God you help, and God’s Holy Gospels.</p>

<p>In the Mayoralty of John Warde, the after-mentioned ordinance was entered as
to the election of Commoners for the Common Council of the City, to the effect that,
whereas heretofore such Commoners had been elected by the Wards, in future the
Commoners for the Common Council of the City should be elected by the respective
Mysteries, and not by the Wards; that is to say, six by some of the Mysteries, by
some four, and by some two. And for the purpose of so doing, bills were sent by
the Mayor, not to the Aldermen, but to the rulers of the respective Mysteries. But
so long as this ordinance continued in force, tumults increased among the people,
and the great were held in contempt by the small. Consequently, great disputes
and divisions arose among the citizens, as was seen at the elections of
Nicholas Brembre, John Northamptone, and other Mayors, etc. After this, however,
the more discreet and more worthy persons of the said City being called
together, a long discussion was held as to the amendment of the said ordinance;
and at length it was determined that, in accordance with the approved and established
practice of ancient and praiseworthy usage, the Common Council should thenceforth
be formed by the Wards only, and not by the Mysteries. And this usage, in
reference to the great meetings in Common Council, is continued and observed to
the present day.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, Riley’s translation, pp. 36-37.)</p>

<p>Upon the Sheriff’s Court was laid a great quantity of work and responsibility.</p>

<p>There was also the Bishop’s Court for questions connected with Church
property and the claims of the Church.</p>

<p>The officers of the City consisted of the following:—</p>

<p>First the principal officers—</p>

<p>Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs.</p>

<p>The Court of Common Council.</p>

<p>The Recorder, the Chamberlain, the Common Serjeant-at-Law, the Common
Clerk.</p>

<p>The Common Serjeant-at-Arms or the Common Crier, the Clerks of the
proceedings, the Serjeants of the Mayor and the Chamberlain, the Constables, the
Scavagers, the Bedels, the Brokers, the Ale-Conners, the Under-Sheriffs and the
Clerks of the Sheriffs, the Sheriffs’ Serjeants, the Serjeants’ Grooms, the Bailiffs of
the Market, the Wardens and Bailiffs of the Bridge, etc.</p>

<p>There was great jealousy as to admission to the freedom of the City.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>
<p>“Also, because as well in times past, out of memory, as also in modern times,
the City aforesaid is wont to be defended and governed by the aid and counsels as
well of the reputable men of the trades-merchant as of the other trades-handicraft;
and from of old it hath been the usage, that no strange person, native or alien, as to
whose conversation and condition there is no certain knowledge, shall be admitted
to the freedom of the City, unless first, the merchants or traders of the City following
the trade which the person so to be admitted intends to adopt, shall be lawfully
convoked; that so, by such his fellow-citizens, so convoked, the Mayor and Aldermen,
aforesaid, being certified as to the condition and trustworthiness of the persons
so to be admitted, may know whether such persons ought to be admitted or rejected;
the whole community demands, that the form aforesaid, so far as concerns the more
important trades and handicrafts, shall in future be inviolably observed, that so no
person in future may against the provision aforesaid be admitted to the freedom of
the City.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>, p. 425.)</p>

<p>On the post and duties of the Coroner, Dr. Reginald Sharpe (<cite>Letter Book B</cite>)
furnishes valuable information.</p>

<p>The functions of Coroner were exercised by the Chamberlain and Sheriffs.
The King’s butler, to whom the office of Coroner belonged, was generally made
City Chamberlain. In December 1302 the King’s Writ notified the Mayor and
Sheriffs that William Trente, his Chamberlain, to whose bailiwick the office of
Coroner in the City belonged (<i lang="la">ad cujus ballivam officium Coronatoris ... pertinet</i>),
being busy on affairs of State, had deputed John le Clerk to act as Coroner.</p>

<p>More than once the citizens endeavoured to get the appointment of Coroner
into their own hands. It was Edward the Fourth who, in consideration of a sum of
£7000, gave the City a Charter which, among other things, enabled the citizens to
appoint their own Coroner.</p>

<p>“The customary procedure of holding an inquest on the body of any one who
had died in the City, otherwise than by his rightful death (<i lang="la">ex alia morte quam recta
morte sua</i>), was as follows:—After receiving notice of such a death having occurred,
and of the body of the deceased lying in a certain house in a certain ward, the
Chamberlain (or Coroner) and Sheriffs proceeded thither, and having summoned a
jury (drawn partly from the ward in which the body was found, and partly from
two, or sometimes three, of the nearest wards), set to work to diligently inquire
(<i lang="la">diligenter inquisiverunt</i>) how the deceased came by his death. If the Chamberlain
and Sheriffs failed to hold an inquest, or held an insufficient one, in cases where the
Justices Itinerant thought an inquest necessary, they were amerced.</p>

<p>The jurors were practically both judges and witnesses, and gave evidence as to
all the facts connected with the deceased’s death, so far as they could be ascertained.
The corpse was then viewed, and if its appearance tallied with the evidence given,
and the jury were decided as to who caused the death, a precept was issued for the
arrest of the felon (if not already in custody), and his goods were valued, for which
the Sheriffs were answerable. The discoverer of the corpse, as well as those who
witnessed the felony, and two or four neighbours, were usually attached by sureties
to appear, if required, before the Justices Itinerant at their next coming to
the City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>Not only was the discoverer of the corpse bound to raise the hue and cry so
that the neighbours (<i lang="la">patria</i>) might come and assist in the capture of the felon, but
every one who saw the felony committed was bound to do the same, and to lose no
time in giving notice to the Chamberlain and Sheriffs, or risk imprisonment on the
appearance of the Justices.” (<cite>Letter Book B</cite>, p. xii.)</p>

<p>The custom of deodand, which was kept up until very recently, was curious.
The thing which caused the death of any person by misadventure became forfeited
to the King by way of deodand, or gift of God. In course of time not the thing
itself, but its value, was the deodand. Thus, if a horse, a boat, a beam, caused the
death of any one, its value was forfeited and paid to the Sheriffs for the Mayor and
Corporation.</p>

</div>

<p>The laws by which London was governed are too long for quotation; they are
explicitly set forth in <cite>Liber Albus</cite>. In the year 1191 it was provided that a body of
twelve Aldermen should be elected in full Husting, in order to decide all questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
that might arise over the enclosure of land; they also had the power to prevent the
erection of any wooden house; the walls, either party wall or outside wall, were to be
sixteen feet high at least, and three feet thick; and the roofs were to be of tiles or
slate instead of thatch. The law, like so many mediæval laws, was sensible and
necessary. It fell through, as did all mediæval laws, for want of police to execute it.
In London there were thousands of houses at that moment built of wood with roofs
of thatch. There does not appear to have been any attempt made to replace wood
with stone. That, indeed, would have been impossible on account of the cost; but,
at least, as houses fell down, and many of them in the narrow courts were only
wattle and daub, an attempt might have been made to replace them with more
substantial houses having roofs of tiles. The mediæval way was to understand very
clearly what ought to be, then to pass a law commanding that thing to be, and then
to sit down, with the feeling that duty had been done.</p>

<p>The general regulations which governed the daily life are given under the
heading of “Inquisitions at the Ward Motes”:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“You shall present if the peace of his lordship the King has been broken, or any affray made
within the Ward since the last Wardmote, and by what person or persons the same was done: or if
any covin or assemblage against the peace of his lordship the King has been made.</p>

<p>Item, if there is any one resident or harboured within the Ward, who is not a lawful person, or
not of good fame, or not under frank-pledge.</p>

<p>Item, if any woman of lewd life, or common scold, or common bawd, or courtesan, is resident
within the Ward.</p>

<p>Item, if there is any oven, furnace, or defective reredos within the Ward, whereby it is likely that
there may arise misadventure by fire; or if any persons use other fuel than wood or charcoal, against the
Ordinance of the City.</p>

<p>Item, if any taverners, brewsters, hostelers, or chandlers, sell without measures sealed with the seal
of the Alderman or of the Chamber of the Guildhall; and if any one of them sells against the Assize
made thereon by the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City; and if any one of them
receives gamesters or other riotous persons after the hour forbidden by the Ordinance of the City; and
if there are any persons in the Ward who are outlawed.</p>

<p>Item, if there is any huckster in the Ward.</p>

<p>Item, if any house in the Ward is covered with any other roofing than tiles, lead or stone, and none
with reeds or straw.</p>

<p>Item, if there is any one whose practice it is to place filth in any streets and lanes within the Ward,
and offensively before the doors of others.</p>

<p>Item, if any swine or cows are reared within the Ward, to the annoyance of the neighbours.</p>

<p>Item, if any leper is resident in the Ward.</p>

<p>Item, if any bargain of usury has been made within the Ward since the last Wardmote.</p>

<p>Item, if any purprestures are made in the streets or lanes, or upon the walls or fosses, of the City,
or upon the Thames or other common soil within the Ward.</p>

<p>Item, if any baker of tourte bread bakes white bread, or the converse.</p>

<p>Item, if there are any persons in the habit of wandering within the Ward after forbidden hours,
and in manner forbidden by the Common Council of the City.</p>

<p>Item, if any officer of the City has made extortion or affray within the Ward under colour of his
office, to the wrong and detriment of any person; and what it is that has been so done, and how done;
or if any person is a maintainer or champertour of litigation that is carried on within the Ward.</p>

<p>Item, if any person pays, or gives as wages unto, masons, carpenters, daubers, tilers, or any other
labourers whatsoever, more than is ordained.</p>

<p>Item, if the ale-stake of any tavern is longer or extends further than is ordained.” (<cite>Liber Albus</cite>,
Riley’s translation, p. 290.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows the regulation of various trades. The baker comes first, subject
to so many rules and prohibitions that one is surprised to find any one willing
to practise the mystery. Millers, brewers, and sellers of ale, are also taken
under paternal surveillance. Usury is strictly forbidden—the frequency of the
prohibition shows how powerless the law was to prevent it. The companies
had Hall Motes, or meetings of their members, twice a year, at which their
ordinances were to be read. No one was to take more than two or three
apprentices, and then for a term of at least seven years. No one was to be
wandering on the streets after curfew, unless he was a man of repute or his
servant. No one was to carry arms in the City. Every Alderman was to keep
a good watch on his Ward. None but free men were to be admitted to the
freedom of the City. Wager of battle does not lie between persons free of
the City, unless they consented thereto.</p>

<p>In addition to the Courts already mentioned, there were the Courts of the
Sokes; that is to say, of those places which were outside the jurisdiction of the
City; such were the places called afterwards Liberties.</p>

<p>The Iter, or Eyre, was a holding by the Justices Itinerant of the Pleas of
the Crown, at which the citizens received, and had to answer a series of questions
on, their Privileges, Customs, Liberties, and Rights. It was a Court which could
be held in a day or two, without giving much trouble, or it was a Court which
could be vexatious and oppressive to the highest degree.</p>

<p>John Carpenter is as full and explicit on the subject of the Iter as can be
desired. He contemplated that it would be got through in a day or two. But it
was a solemn and important function. The Justices sat in the Great Hall of the
Tower; on the day appointed, all the laymen of the City were bound to meet
at All Hallows at Barking, properly arrayed—“all the laymen”—does this mean
the whole body of merchants, traders, and craftsmen? That might mean a company
of 40,000 men! During the holding of the Pleas, no shop, seld, cellar, or solar
was to be kept open, and nothing was to be sold. Evidently, therefore, the Iter
was not expected to take long:—</p>

<p>“Also, upon the same day, by sanction of the Common Council of the City,
there should be sent from Berkyngecherche six or more of the more serious,
honourable, and discreet Barons of the City; who are to enter the Tower for
the purpose of saluting and welcoming his lordship the King, his Council, and his
Justiciars, on behalf of the City; begging of them that, if it so please his lordship
the King, they may safely appear before them in the said Tower, saving all their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
liberties and customs unto the Mayor and all other citizens. For his lordship the
King and all his predecessors, Kings of England, and their Justiciars, have always
preserved unto all the citizens their liberties safe and unimpaired.</p>

<p>And further, the men before named should show unto his lordship the King,
and unto his Council and his Justiciars, that, on behalf of his lordship the King,
they ought to forbid any person to presume to keep ward at the doors or gates
unless he be one of their own fellow-citizens, and by them thereunto appointed.
Nor should any marshal or crier appear among their fellow-citizens unless he be
one of their number, and acting by desire of the said citizens. For, in accordance
with the liberties of the City, they ought, and of usage are wont, to have no porter,
usher, marshal, or crier, except of their own number, and such persons as they
shall think fit. All the gates and doors are to be kept open to the Barons and
to all the citizens, so long as the Pleas of the Crown are being holden, to the
end, that they may have free ingress and egress. For so it ought, and of usage
is wont, to be.</p>

<p>After this, three men, discreet and moderate, should be chosen; one of them
is to present unto his lordship the King, and unto his Council and Justiciars,
in due order, such haps and mishaps concerning the Crown of his lordship the
King as have occurred within the City, from the time when the pleas were last
holden down to the present time: while the other two men are to remain standing
by the said presenter, the one namely on his right hand and the other on his left.
And if it should so happen that while thus making the presentment he becomes
fatigued, one of these is to continue such presentment. And if by any chance he
should commit an error in making the presentment, he must in a low voice be
corrected by the two who are standing by, it being understood that no other
person shall in any way presume to disturb or to correct such presenter, but only
the two who are standing by him, in manner already mentioned. No tumult, no
murmur, no strife, no debate with one another, is to be going on among the
people while such presentments are being made; but all persons are to keep
themselves quiet and without litigation, as they would preserve the honour and
the liberties of the City, and to the end that the presenter may be heard by all
and duly understood in peace.</p>

<p>It should also be known and kept in memory that, in the case of all things
charged against the Barons and the community of the citizens, the answer to be
made by the City is this—That although they may be fully instructed and certified
how to make answer, still, they will not advisedly make answer thereto; but,
after holding counsel and conference together thereupon, they will make answer
by the Common Council, saving always the liberties of the City. And for the
purpose of preparing such answers, four-and-twenty persons or more must be
chosen from the Common Council, who shall forthwith proceed to hold a Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Council of the City for ensuring the safety and protection of the whole body of
the citizens. And no stranger shall thrust himself among them, to hear the
counsels of the City, so long as they shall be thus holding conference together
thereon.</p>

<p>After the Justiciars of his lordship the King shall have handed and shown
unto the Mayor and Barons of the City the articles pertaining unto the Crown,
they shall immediately demand a fitting day, for the purpose of making due
preparation and taking counsel thereon, to the end that they may be able safely
to make answer to the said articles upon the day so granted unto them by the
Justiciars; and that in the meantime they may be enabled discreetly to enrol and
brief the same articles and their answers thereto.</p>

<p>From the four-and-twenty men or more before mentioned, four persons or
more should be selected, of the Common Council of the City, to be associated
with the Mayor for the purpose more especially of making answer to the charges
and articles aforesaid. Also the Mayor’s Clerk, together with the Common Clerk
of the City and the Sheriffs’ Clerks, shall be seated before them for the purpose
of noting by way of memorial all such charges that are made; lest the same,
through default of being so noted, should be lost in oblivion. And one of such
persons must act as prothonotary; from whose notes all the others are to take
copy, in setting down as well the King’s charges as the answers made by the
community.</p>

<p>Also, as concerning the Sheriffs and Aldermen, provision must be made as
follows:—The Sheriffs are to have their serjeants there present, and all the
Aldermen the bedels of their Wards, becomingly and fairly arrayed and shod,
prompt and ready to perform and fulfil the commands of the Mayor and Barons
of the City, according to such injunctions as may be given to each; their capes,
too, and cloaks laid aside, they are to be fairly arrayed in coats and surcoats,
bearing straight white wands in their hands. Of these, too, four or more, as may
be necessary, must be assigned to the office of keeping the gates and doors; as
also two criers, and certain others who are to act as marshals, in fulfilling such
duties as may be enjoined them. And if perchance any one of these should be
an aged man, weak or infirm, or have sore eyes, then, at the common expense,
another person must be substituted in his place, and of the same ward, efficiently
to perform such duties. And as to such men, due precautions should be taken
that they be seemly and proper persons, newly shaven and shorn.”</p>

<p>The following are “Articles touching his lordship the King”:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>
<p>“Of default made in appearing before the Justiciars. Of those who are at
the King’s mercy, and have not been amerced. Of old Pleas of the Crown which
have been formerly holden before the Justiciars, and have not been determined.
Of new Pleas which have since arisen. Of youths of high parentage and of
damsels, who are, and who ought to be, in the wardship of his lordship the King:
in whose wardship they are, and through whom, and what is the value of their

as of corn, and all measures (of length). Of wines sold contrary to the assize,
and who has sold the same. Of treasures-trove, what they are, and who found
the same. Of Christian usurers who have died, who they were, and what chattels

them. Of the seaports; if the same have been well-guarded, and if any one
has carried corn or other things to the territories of the King’s enemies for sale.
Of those who have taken lack of the thirteenths; who they are, and how much
they have taken, and from whom. Of serjeants of hundreds or others who have
taken reward from men on account of the thirteenths; who they are, and how
much, and from whom. Of those who are wont to do injury in parks and piscaries;
who they are, and where they have done so, and in what parks and piscaries. Of
fugitives, if any one has returned since his flight. Of prises taken by Sheriffs
or Constable, or by any Bailiff, against the will of those whose chattels were to
be taken. Of forgers and clippers of the coin.”</p>

<p>But in the Iter of 4 Henry the Third there were only eighteen questions put
to the citizens. Both questions and answers turn on points of law. It will readily
be understood that such an inquisition was at all times irksome, and might be made
tyrannical and intolerable. The Iter of 1321 was such an occasion. It was made
to last for six months. One cannot suppose that shops were shut and nothing
bought and sold for the whole of that time. The articles and questions submitted
to the citizens were more than a hundred in number, and many of them required an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
investigation of more than twenty years back. In a word, the Justices had come
to the Tower with instructions to make themselves as disagreeable as possible, to
prolong the inquiries, raise objections, and make difficulties. They carried out
these instructions, the citizens becoming more and more indignant. It was intended
to prove that the City had been guilty of irregularities, such as to warrant the
King’s taking it into his own hands.</p>

<p>Six months after the commencement of these proceedings, however, an insurrection
was threatened in Wales. This made it desirable not to exasperate the
Londoners any more, and the Iter was brought to a sudden close.</p>

<p>Let us, at this point, consider briefly the relations of London with the King.
London, as we know already, except for a very brief period, had no over-lord except
the King himself. This, one of her greatest privileges, caused the personal
character of the Sovereign to be even more strongly felt by the citizens of London
than by the rest of the Kingdom. In London, far more than in the rest of the
country, the cause of order and authority rested upon the personal character of the
King. If he were strong, the City was well-ordered; if he were weak, the City
fell into disorder and confusion. Edward the First, when the City was manifestly
beyond the control of the officers, deposed the Mayor for a time and governed the
City by his own Warden till order was re-established. This power of the King
over the City was not considered usurpation; it was part of the recognised order
of things; every citizen knew that he was a servant of the King. On this point
let me quote certain wholesome words of Cunningham (<cite>Hist. of Trade</cite>, p. 131):—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Of all the cant which is current in the present day about history, none is more pernicious than that
which despises the story of real personages and real events and busies itself about abstractions, which tells
us that it is not concerned with kings and battles, but with the life of the people. It is true indeed that
in modern times the life of the people can be treated apart from the consideration of the personal character
of George IV. or William IV. But in the Norman reigns this was not the case; security for person and
property, intercourse with other nations and commercial advance were directly connected with the personal
character of the King; the life of the people was most deeply affected in every way by the strength or
weakness of his disposition.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The King’s revenue was made up of many distinct branches: (1) there were
the Royal domain, manor, and estates scattered about the country and let to
tenants; (2) there were the fines paid on great occasions; (3) pre-emption, that
is, the right of buying what he pleased at his own price; when his purveyors
bought goods exposed for sale this was called “prise”; (4) military tenures, by
which for each five tithes of land the King might demand a knight’s services for
forty days; (5) aids and fines, as on great occasions, such as the marrying of the
King’s daughter; (6) the wealth of the Jews who were the King’s property; he
was heir to their estates, and could without question seize on all they had;
(7) Danegeld, which William continued; its name was changed but the tax
remained; (8) tallages, which were aids in time of special need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>All the taxes were at first on estate. Henry the Second introduced taxation
on movables. Sometimes it was a fifteenth. The nature of this tax may be
imagined by supposing it to be imposed upon a trader’s stock at the present day.
His stock is worth, suppose, £9000; he would pay £600 upon it. But he has
a house with furniture, plate, pictures, and books which have accumulated for
two or three generations. The contents of the house are worth, say, £3000. He
would have to pay £200 on this account. He has £12,000 invested; he must pay
£800 on the investments. He would have, then, to pay at one call £1600 in taxes.
These taxes were not imposed all at the same time, nor on the same class; one
year the clergy were called upon, another the knights, on another occasion the
City of London would be taxed. It seems to us an arbitrary method; but then
we have lost the sense of kingly authority. To our ancestors, whom we must not
consider as prophets, it was a right and proper thing that a man should be called
upon by the King at any moment to surrender a great slice of his property.</p>

<p>It was the first proof of a bad King that he demanded these aids too frequently.
It was another proof that in spite of his aids he allowed the country to fall into disorder.
At such times the hapless trader found it impossible to carry on his business
in a country infested by robbers and over seas infested by pirates. Yet, even then,
the King was still demanding more and more. The best, the only hope of the
citizens was, not to be free from the King, but that the King should make his
authority felt over them as well as over the country. They wanted a King like
Henry the First, Henry the Second, or Edward the First. It was the greatest
blessing to London that their Kings were, with one or two exceptions, strong and
clear-headed men.</p>

<p>The King also exercised authority over the Moneyers and the Mint.
Formerly there were mints in many places; we have seen how Henry the First
treated those who debased the coin. Henry the Second kept the Mint in London,
where he could control it more effectually. He also set up an office in the Mint
for the exchange of foreign money: a great convenience to foreign merchants.</p>

<p>In the year 1312, letters were sent by the King, Edward the Second, to the
City of London concerning the safe keeping of the City. The method of reception
of a Royal Communication by the Mayor and Aldermen may be learned from
Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite> (p. 93). The following is the letter:—</p>

<p>“Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord, etc., to the Mayor,
and Aldermen, and all the commonalty of our City of London, greeting.
Forasmuch as we do confide very much in the loyalty that is among you, and
the affection which you have towards ourselves, such as you ought to have for your
liege lord; and, more especially, for the love which we have, and at all times have
had, towards you, as you well know; we do pray you affectionately, and do command
and charge you, strictly enjoining, on the fealty which unto us you owe, and as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
wish to save your bodies, and your heritages, and whatsoever you have, from
penalty of negligence as regards us, that you cause our City of London right safely
and surely to be kept, in behalf of ourselves and of our heirs; that so no damage or
peril may befall it—the which God forbid—for default of good and sufficient guard;
and that our lordship and our estate be there saved in all points, without any
manner of blemish, as we do especially trust in you, and as you would eschew
peril unto yourselves. And understand so well this our command, and have it so
tenderly at heart, that we may be able to praise you for the same, and that nought
of our right, or of our lordship, in our City be lost, on peril of losing whatsoever
unto us you may forfeit. Given under our Privy Seal, at York, the 21st day of
January, in the 5th year of our reign.”</p>

<p>In addition to this general letter, the following letter was sent separately to the
leading citizens, viz.:—</p>

<p>“To John de Gisorz. To John de Lincoln. To Thomas Romain. To Henry
de Durham. To William Servat. To John de Wengrave. To William Trente.
To Richer de Refham. To William de Leyre. To John de Burford. To Simon
Corp. To William de Forneis. To William Walrain. To William Bidik. To
Robert de Keleseye. To Stephen de Abyndone. To Ralph le Balancer. To
Hamond Godchep. To Robert le Callere. To Edmond Lambyn.”</p>

<p>“Edward, etc., to our well-beloved John de Gisorz, our Mayor of London,
greeting. As we have sent word unto you, to the Aldermen, and to the
Commonalty, of our City of London, that among you and them, in whose loyalty
we do greatly trust, for the affection which you have towards ourselves, as towards
your liege lord, especially for the love which we have, and at all times have had,
towards you and those of the said City; and as you would yourselves save your
bodies, your heritages, and whatsoever you have to save, from penalty of
negligence as regards ourselves, you do cause our said City right safely and surely
to be kept in our behalf; that so no damage or peril may befall it—the which God
forbid—and that our lordship and our estate may there be saved in all points,
without any manner of blemish; and as we do know that you are the man in
London by whose counsels is guided the manhood thereof, and are persuaded that
the manhood of our said City will charge itself with the safe-keeping of the same
our City, and most willingly would save it to the use of us and of our heirs, as is
right; we do command and charge you, on the fealty which unto us you owe, and as
you would wish to eschew the penalty aforesaid, that you use all diligence and all
counsel as towards the said manhood of the City, and towards all those of our said
City, who shall be most available towards the safe-keeping thereof, that they undertake
such safe-keeping, and cause the same our City so safely and surely to be kept,
in behalf of us and our heirs, that nought of our right, or of our lordship, be lost
therein; and that so we may be able to perceive the diligence that you shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
employed herein; for the which we may be the more especially beholden to you.
Given under our Privy Seal, at York, the 21st day of January, in the 5th year of
our reign” (pp. 94-95).</p>

<p>In consequence of these letters, John de Gisors, the Mayor, called together
the Aldermen and some of the commonalty of each ward on the Saturday after the
Purification, <i>i.e.</i> on the 2nd of February. It is remarkable that only seventeen
Aldermen are named in the list; that eight did not appear at the meeting; and
that, of those to whom the separate letters had been written, only three obeyed the
King’s special invitation.</p>

<p>However, at the meeting certain ordinances were passed for the repair and the
safety of the walls and the gates and the quay. Elsewhere these and similar orders
have been set forth.</p>

<p>These regulations passed, the Mayor sent a letter to the King:—</p>

<p>“Whereas, Sire, you have demanded of us by your letters that we should
cause to be guarded and safely kept your said City in behalf of yourself and your
heirs, according as is in your mandate contained; know, Sire, that of the same wish
we ourselves are, and at all times have been, and always will be, to the best of our
lawful power, if God so please. And we do let you know that your said City is in
good condition, may God be thanked; and your people set in good array, according
as the times demand; and that ordinance has been made to strengthen and to
repair the gates, and the defaults in the walls, and divers other things which
pertain to the safe-keeping of the said City, so speedily as ever the same may be
properly done. Unto God, our most dear Lord, we commend you, and may he
save you and keep you; and may he grant unto you a good life, and a long” (p. 97).</p>

<p>To this letter was appended a very singular and suggestive rider, which the
bearer was instructed to lay before the King:—</p>

<p>“Under the first head:—that the murage which our Lord the King has
granted to the City, and wherewith the old walls of the City ought to be
repaired, strengthened and amended, is now spent upon the new wall behind
the Friars Preachers at Castle Baynard, towards the Thames, by your command
and nowhere else.</p>

<div class="caption">S.W. VIEW OF GERRARD’S HALL</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">(Gisors’ Hall, Basing Lane, otherwise denoted Gerrard’s Hall Inn, the residence of Sir John Gisors, Mayor of London in 1245,
1246, and 1259; it descended to another Sir John Gisors, Mayor and Constable of the Tower, in 1311-1314; and was
possessed by several of that family until 1386, when it was alienated by Thomas Gisors.) From <cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>.</p></blockquote>


<p>Also, that such outlays and costs, which are great, and are hastily expended
upon so many repairs, whereas in justice they ought to be levied from all those who
have rents, and tenements, and moveables, within the City, commonly fall upon one
part of the citizens only, and not upon persons of the religious Orders, and others
who have franchises by charter and in almoigne<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>; to the amount indeed of the third
part of the rental of the said City. And such persons are not willing to give any
portion thereof, or any aid or contribution, or any assistance, thereto, although they
are saved just as much throughout the said city as the rest of the citizens. And if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the King shall see fit, and deem it good that they should aid therein, the people of
the City will be the better comforted, and the better strengthened, and the more
speedily will they have the City put in due repair.”</p>

<p>So that the new piece of wall outside the Black Friars, and between their
House and the Fleet, was not built by the Friars at all as is sometimes stated, but
out of the murage granted by the King, and it will also be observed that so early as
1312, before the new ideas had been started, there were grumblings at the exemption
of the Religious from taxation and a complaint that their property amounted
to a third part of the rental of the whole City.</p>

From Young’s <cite>Annals of the Barber Surgeons</cite>.</div>
</div>

<p>The comparative wealth of London at the time of the Conquest is shown by
the fact that the City was assessed for Danegeld at 1200 hides: that Westminster
was assessed at 118 hides; and Middlesex at 853-1/2 hides; that London paid £120,
Middlesex £85: 0: 6; and, one supposes, on the same scale, Westminster £11: 16s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>Though London was never separated in feeling or in fact from the country,
though the sons of the country gentlemen came up to London and were there
apprenticed, trade was carried on between London and the country with as many
laws, restrictions, and regulations, as if the towns were in a foreign state. This
was not due to jealousies of the City or the towns, but mainly in consequence
of the authority of the over-lord. For instance, the customs of Chester with
reference to “foreign” merchants—those of London were foreign—show three
separate jurisdictions in the City: that of the King, that of the Earl, and that of
the Bishops. Trade with the interior was chiefly conducted at the fairs. During
the fair, the people came from all the country round, including those who,
like the Friars in later years, roamed about the villages and farms selling small
things.</p>

<p>Let us make a special inquiry into the contribution of London to the Royal
treasury. There were the customs dues of the Port; the customs tolls of the City
Gates and the City Markets, the “Stallages” of the tradesmen, the fines of
foreigners, the dues of Billingsgate and Queen Hithe; some of these were paid to
the Corporation and some to the King’s officers. Whenever the money was paid
into the Exchequer, it was weighed and assayed. Thus, on one occasion the
Sheriffs paid in £245 odd on account of money due. The coin was assayed and
found 13d. in the pound short. On a second trial it was found 12d. in the
pound short. Thereupon the Sheriffs demanded a third trial. The accounts were
kept by means of tallies, and for counters they used Venetian shillings and gold
besants.</p>

<p>Apart from the customs and the Crown lands, the King’s revenues were largely
increased by Fines, Amercements, “Misericordia,” Aids, Scutage and Tallage,
all of which were methods of profound interest to the City. As regards fines, there
were fines for everything. They were inflicted in the shape of money, horses, wine,
hawks, dogs, lampreys, robes, Flemish caps and other things. In the pages of
Madox one may read how men paid fines for becoming an Alderman, for the right
to succeed to a property, for the King’s help in recovering debts from the Jews, for
permission not to plead except in a certain manner, for permission to plead at all,
for permission to summon a man, for permission for a jury of matrons to inquire
whether a certain woman has or has not borne a child, for an inquiry whether a
man was out with John in rebellion, to examine into a pedigree, to inquire into
old customs, for permission to move that certain persons ought not to sit on a Jury,
for an inquiry whether a certain man was accused unjustly or not, for petitioning the
King that the Itinerant Justices might visit a town, for speeding a cause, for delaying
a cause, for leave to hold office, for leave to quit office, for leave to marry, for leave
(for a woman) to remain unmarried if she pleased (for life, or for five years—a very
great number of widows desired to remain unmarried), for leave to marry a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
woman (Geoffrey de Mandeville paid a fine of £20,000, certainly equal to half a
million of our money, for leave to marry Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, with all her
estates), for leave to form a Guild, to import and export, for the concord of a duel,
for leave to have a servant.</p>

<p>Now and then the list of fines makes one wonder what story is hidden behind
them. For instance, why was the wife of Hugh de Nevill fined for permission to
stay one night with her husband? Was he in prison? Again, Reginald de
Tewarden is fined twenty marks for permission to keep his lands after he had
undergone the ordeal of hot iron unsuccessfully, and had abjured the country. He
was proved guilty apparently. And was the fine of twenty marks thought the kind
of penalty that would meet the case? William de Thievespathe—ominous name!—makes
the same request for the same cause and with the same result. The iron,
therefore, was sometimes hot. Another man, one Gospatric, pays twenty marks as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
a fine to escape the ordeal of hot iron. William of Sixteen Tale pays the large fine
of £80 for wounding a priest: Robert, son of Hugh, gets off with £7: 2: 9—enough,
however, to break a craftsman—for wounding “a man”; observe the difference
between a man and a priest. Lawrence the Priest has to pay twenty marks “pro
homine ementulato.” Who, again, was “Jeremy of London”? He took sanctuary,
he refused to come out, they fined him a hundred shillings, and then? There is no
more. Margaret FitzRoger has to pay a fine of £1000 before she can get at her
inheritance, to wit, her father’s estate, her husband’s, her own dower, which her son
has got, and be released from certain debts to the Jews. Sometimes the fine took
the form of a bribe, as when Nathaniel Leveland, hereditary keeper of the King’s
houses at Westminster and on the banks of the Fleet, sent in a fine of sixty marks
for permission to keep that office, and Osbert de Longchamp paid the same fine
for permission to take over those offices.</p>

<p>Every fine, whatever the amount, was either increased by a small sum or contained
that small sum, which was called Aurum Reginæ, the Queen’s Gold. Thus
when Thomas FitzAnther was forgiven his fine of ten marks, the Aurum Reginæ
was at the same time remitted. In the year 1253 the City of London was called
upon to pay up the Aurum Reginæ, part of the fine for receiving back their
liberties, and in 1254 the Sheriffs were ordered to distrain for the amount.</p>

<p>Now the method of promoting virtue and filling the coffers was by the
<i lang="la">misericordia</i> or amercement. I cannot understand the difference between the two.
But that matters little, they both meant a fine. By studying the long list of cases
furnished by my authority, Madox,<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> I arrive at a theory, not a conclusion, that the
amercement was a punishment for offences which could not be tried in a criminal
court, yet were real offences. Thus, for false or unjust accusations or plaints, a man
was amerced, or for unjust detainer, for offences in the forests, trespass, etc., for
making a man fight two duels in one day, a thing manifestly unfair, for “ill keeping”
a duel, <i>i.e.</i>, not observing all the rules respecting duels, for claiming to be a free man
when one was but a villein, for detaining sheep, for harbouring a man who was not
in frank-pledge, for making again a dyke which the King had caused to be levelled,
for using twice in ordeal an iron which had been heated only once, gross injustice to
the second man, for burying a drowned man without the view by the King’s servant,
for putting a man to the ordeal of water (was it then forbidden?), for trespass, and
in the case of a rebellious bride, for not coming to be married on the day appointed.
For these, and similar offences, the citizens suffered amercement and <i lang="la">misericordia</i>.</p>

<p>More formidable than any of these, more dreaded than fine, amercement, or
<i lang="la">misericordia</i>, were the Aid, the Relief, the Scutage, and the Tallage.</p>

<p>There were three principal kinds of aid. (1) The aid <i lang="fr">pur fille marier</i>, or the
occasion of the marriage of the King’s daughter. Henry the First took for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
daughter’s marriage three shillings on each hide. Henry the Second, for his part,
imposed a tax under this name of one mark for every knight’s fee. As great lords
might hold many knights’ fees, the tax was considerable. (2) The aid <i lang="fr">pur faire
chevaler</i>, on the occasion of conferring knighthood on the King’s son. This tax was
the same in amount as the preceding. The third kind of aid was the raising of
money if necessary for the King’s ransom.</p>

<div class="caption">A TALLY FOR 6S. 8D. ISSUED BY EDWARD I.’S TREASURER TO THE SHERIFF OF LINCOLNSHIRE</div>
</div>

<p>Reliefs were simply arbitrary sums exacted by the King. The relief of the
knight’s fee in the reign of Henry the Second was five pounds; that of a baron one
hundred pounds. Scutage was, as its name denotes, an assessment of the knights’
fees.</p>

<p>Tallage corresponded more closely with our modern taxes. The City, ordered
to make up so much money, assessed its lands separately at so much, which the
Aldermen of each portion was bound to collect by assessing all the free men in his
ward. In some cases, private merchants, those known to be wealthy, were separately
assessed. Thus in one tallage Hugh de Basing is assessed at twelve marks,
Thomas de Plaines at ten marks, William FitzAdam at a hundred shillings. Sometimes
the King’s officers are separately assessed, as when the moneyers of London,
Archard, Lefwine Besant, and Ailwine Finch, were ordered to pay respectively a
hundred shillings, five marks, and two marks.</p>

<p>We also find the City disputing the right of the King to tallage them. Madox
relates the story:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In or about the 39th year of King Henry III. it was provided by the King’s Council at
Merton, that the King should tallage his Demeanes in England towards the great Expenses he had been at
in foreign Parts. The citizens of London being called before the King and his Council at Merton about
tallaging the City, Ralf Hardell, the Mayor, with several others came, and the King demanded of them
a Tallage of three thousand Marks. When they had consulted with their Fellow-citizens, they came and
offered two thousand Marks by way of Aid, saying, They could not, nor would give more. Upon this the
King sent his Treasurer, Philip Lovell, with others to St. Martin’s to receive of the City a fine of three
thousand Marks for Tallage, in case they would enter into such Fine, and if they would not, then they
were ordered to assess the Tallage <i lang="la">per Capita</i>. The City refusing to enter into that Fine, the Treasurer
and the other Commissioners were about to assess the Tallage <i lang="la">per Capita</i>, ordering the Citizens to swear
concerning the Value of each other’s Chattells. The Citizens refused to make such Oath, or to declare
upon the Faith they owed to the King the Value of each other’s chattells. So the Treasurer and other
Commissioners came back <i lang="la">re infecta</i>. Afterwards the Citizens came before the King and his Council at
Westminster on the Sunday after Candlemas. It was there disputed whether this should be called a
Tallage or an Aid. The King ordered Search to be made, whether the Citizens had formerly paid Tallage
to the King or his Ancestours. Upon Search, it was found both in the Rolls of the Exchequer and of the
Chancery, that in the 16th year of King John, the Citizens were tallaged at two thousand Marks,
to have the Interdict taken off; that in the 7th year of King Henry III. they were tallaged at one
thousand Marks; that in the 26th year of the same King, they paid one thousand Marks by way
of Tallage; and that in the 37th year, they gave one thousand Marks and xx Marks of Gold by
way of Tallage. Afterwards, on the Morrow, the Mayor and Citizens came and acknowledged, that they
were talliable, and gave the King three thousand Marks for Tallage.” (Vol. i. p. 711.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In this chapter I have shown, by the aid of John Carpenter, that by the end of
the fifteenth century the days of “Uncertain Steps” were passed away. The New
Order, which gave the power and authority of the City more and more into the
hands of the Commonalty, has now become well defined and established; it is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
constitution of the City; the old feuds have vanished; the old City families have
disappeared; the craftsmen no longer go about bellowing that they are the
Commons; they are reduced to order every one in his own Company, and every
man knowing his place in his Company; the place of the craftsman is one of
obedience; he has been educated by the Company, apprenticed by the Company,
made a freeman of the Company; he works in accordance with the rules of the
Company; he is paid according to its rules; when he is old he will be a pensioner
in the Company; should he die young his widow and children will be the care of
the Company. And instead of the former government of the City by hereditary
right, the City is now governed by the forms of popular election, with safeguards,
by elected Aldermen, elected Sheriffs, elected Common Council, and elected
Wardens as Masters of the Companies. And as to the share which the craftsmen
possessed in the elections the less that question was raised the better it was for the
order and the security of the City.</p>

<small>THE CITY COMPANIES</small></h3>


<blockquote>

<p>We have next to consider the origin, growth, and development of the City
Companies.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the origin and antiquity of Guilds I have already spoken (vol. i. p. 204).
It is impossible to conceive of any time, after men had begun to live in villages and
towns, after arts and crafts had arisen, after some attempt at order had been made,
when there were no such associations as those we call guilds. Those of the same
trade were compelled to band together for the use of tools, for instruction, for the
regulation of the output, for protection of all kinds. In the fifth century there were
“consuls” or chiefs, of the Locksmiths; the bakers of Paris act as a body in the
reign of King Dagobert; in Lombardy they had colleges of artisans; in Ravenna
in the tenth century there was a college of fishermen; there was a chief of the
Corporation of Traders; a chief of the Corporation of Butchers. In Paris in the
year 1162 there were dues payable by the Corporation of Tanners, Shoemakers, and
Pursemakers.</p>

<p>The oldest Guild-Statutes extant in this country are the laws of three Guilds,
those of Abbotsbury, Exeter, and Cambridge. The general principles of the three
are thus summed up by Brentano:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“According to the latest investigation into the origin of Gilds, the drawing-up of all these statutes
took place in the beginning of the eleventh century. In the case of one of these Gilds, there is no doubt
whatever as to the accuracy of this date. This Gild was founded and richly endowed by Orcy, a friend of
Canute the Great, at Abbotsbury, in honour of God and St. Peter. Its object, according to the statutes,
appears to have been the support and nursing of infirm Gild-brothers, the burial of the dead, the
performance of religious services, and the saying of prayers for their souls. The association met every
year, on the feast of St. Peter, for united worship in honour of their patron saint. Beside this, there was
a common meal: and in order that the poor might also have their share in the joys of the festival, they
received alms on the day of the feast; for which purpose the Gild-brothers were obliged to furnish, on the
eve of the day, contributions of bread ‘well boulted and thoroughly baked.’ Guests were only admitted to
the common meal by permission of the Master and Steward. Insults offered in a malignant spirit by one
brother to another, were punished on the part of the Gild, and had also to be atoned for to the insulted.
He who had undertaken an office, but had not properly discharged its duties, was severely punished.</p>

<p>The Exeter Gild, whose statutes have likewise been preserved, was of altogether the same character.
Here, however, association for the purpose of worship and prayer stands out more prominently as the
object of the brotherhood than in the former case. Three times a year the Gild-brothers assembled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
worship together for the well-being of their living and dead fellow-members. Here, also, every such
service was followed by a meal in common. When any brother died, every member was obliged to
perform special devotions for the departed soul. The mutual care of the Gild-brothers was, moreover,
shown by money contributions in case of death, and in the support of those who went on a journey, as
well as of those who had suffered loss by fire. Punishments were decreed for insults offered by the
Gild-brothers to each other, as well as for not fulfilling the duties imposed on them by the Gild.</p>

<p>The statutes of the Gild at Cambridge show that its main object was altogether different from that
of the two already mentioned. At the very outset, in the oath which every member had to take on the
relics of the patron Saint of the Gild, they swore faithful brotherhood towards each other, not only in
religious, but also in secular matters; and though the statutes secured for the Gild-brothers the same
support in case of sickness and death as those of Exeter and Abbotsbury—and, like those, contained
regulations with reference to alms, divine worship and feasts—yet all these objects were but insignificant in
comparison with the measures for the protection of the members of the Gild against criminals, and even
against the evil consequences of their own wrong-doings. The following may be considered a first
principle: ‘If one misdo, let all bear it; let all share the same lot’; and for carrying this out, a complete
organisation existed. If one of the Gild-brothers required the help of his fellow-members, the inferior
officer of the Gild living nearest to him had to hasten to his aid; should the officer neglect this, he became
liable to punishment, and in like manner the head of the society, should he be remiss in affording help.
If a Gild-brother was robbed, the whole Gild had to assist him in obtaining compensation from the
law-breaker. So also every Gild-brother was obliged to help, if a member himself had to make atonement
for killing a man. If, however, he had no justifiable motive for committing the act, if he had not been
provoked to it in a quarrel, if he was not under an obligation to execute vengeance, but had slain the man
merely from malice, he himself had to bear the consequences of the deed. If one Gild-brother killed
another, he had first to reconcile himself with the kinsmen of the murdered man, and had moreover to pay
eight pounds to all those belonging to his larger family, namely, the Gild; failing which, he was shut out of
the society, and the members of the Gild were forbidden to hold friendly intercourse of any kind with him.
In like manner, an insult offered by one Gild-brother to another was severely punished. The solidarity of
the society was even shown in the case of violence and damage to property, which one member might have
suffered from the servant of another; the master of the servant was answerable for him, and was sued by
the society for compensation. It was, moreover, a leading principle of the society, to which every member
had to bind himself by oath, always to support him who had right on his side.</p>

<p>The essence of the manifold regulations of the statutes of these three Gilds appears to be the
brotherly banding together into close unions between man and man, sometimes even established on and
fortified by oath, for the purpose of mutual help and support. This essential characteristic is found in all
the Gilds of every age, from those first known to us in detail, to their descendants of the present day, the
Trade Unions. According to the variety of wants and interests at various times, the aims, arrangements,
and rules of these unions also varied. As a rule, the Gild-brothers periodically assembled together for
common feasts.” (<cite>English Gilds</cite>, p. lxv, Toulmin Smith’s edit.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Stubbs divides the English Guild into three kinds—the Religious Guild, which
had a social side; the Frith Guild; and the Merchant Guild.</p>

<p>I. Let us set forth the ordinances, already summed up, of the Exeter Guild,
which belongs to the first kind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“First, this Society is assembled in Exeter for God’s love and their souls’ profit, both in regard to the
prosperity of this life and the future, which we wish for ourselves in God’s judgment.</p>

<p>1. There shall be three meetings in the year, the first at Michaelmas, the second at the feast of Our
Lady after midwinter, and the third at the feast of All Saints after Easter.</p>

<p>2. Each brother shall contribute two <i lang="la">sextarii</i> of malt, and each cniht one and a portion of honey.</p>

<p>3. The priest shall celebrate two masses, one for the living friends, the other for the dead, at each
meeting; and each brother of lay estate shall recite two psalters, one for the living friends, the other for
the dead. This altogether will make six masses and six psalters, there being three general meetings.</p>

<p>4. At each expedition ordered by the King every brother shall contribute five pence.</p>

<p>5. At a house-burning each brother shall contribute a penny.</p>

<p>6. If any brother neglect an appointment for a meeting on the first occasion he shall pay for three
masses, on the second occasion for five, and on the third occasion no allowance shall be made for the
neglect unless it be through infirmity or his lord’s business.</p>

<p>7. If any brother neglect the appointment of paying his subscription
or contribution let him compensate for it two-fold.</p>

<p>8. If any man of this fellowship revile another, let him compensate
for it with thirty pence. In conclusion the document prays ‘for God’s
love, that every man of this assembly justly observe what we have justly
ordained. God assist us therein.’”</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>As, formerly, each family was a company allied against
the world, so a Guild was the extension of that principle,
and was the association of many families to form one. Thus,
to quote Brentano once more (p. 5):—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The family was, according to these historians (Waitz and Lappenberg),
a community of all-comprehending importance, and its care provided
completely for nearly all the wants of the individual. This it was able
to do in consequence of the then simplicity of life. The minor found in it
his protection; the insulted, the natural friends who sympathised with
him most keenly in every injury inflicted, and who helped him to procure
satisfaction. He who would engage in those pursuits which alone in that
age were worthy of a freeman, and which at the same time promised riches
and fame—in chase, feuds, and war—found in the family his natural allies.
Naturally, he who fell into poverty, or sickness, or any other kind of distress, obtained from the
family the necessary help; and it provided of course for the burial of the dead, whose heir it
was. These are indeed the first, and are even nowadays the practical results of the family union.
For the murdered, there arose from the midst of his family an avenger; to the robbed it gave the
necessary help to prosecute and punish the thief, and to obtain restitution of the plunder. Further
consequences of the nature of the family compact were, that the members were obliged to maintain peace
amongst themselves; that they were not entitled to appear against each other in a court of justice; and,
on the other hand, that they were called upon to punish members, especially women, who had violated the
right of the family. Before the community, too, it became answerable for its members. The payment of
the forfeited <em>wergild</em> was, in all cases of offence—which according to ancient usage and custom claimed
revenge—the concern of the whole family. The family appeared as such an intimate union of its members,
that this responsibility of the whole body for the individual member commended itself to the sense of
justice of the people as a matter of course. But as it answered for the compensation, and took part in the
payment thereof, and assisted the guilty in order that he might not forfeit life and limb to his antagonist,
so it supplied the accused also with compurgators from among its members to ward off an unjust
condemnation. In former times this family bond comprehended all relatives without limitation of degree;
but in later days it became restricted to the nearer kinsfolk.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The regulations of the Guilds resembled each other. Every Guild provided
for its own masses and church services, and for the burial of its members, bringing
the body to be buried, and providing wax lights, alms, and masses. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
of the Guilds as could afford it maintained their own Chaplain; women as well
as men were admitted to membership. Sometimes the Guilds were composed
of quite plain and simple folk; Worcester, it is known, had Guilds of Joiners and
Carpenters, and perhaps of others; Bristol, among others, those of Fullers and
Ringers; Holbeach, of Shepherds; Lynn, of Shipmen; Norwich, of “Peltyers”;
Ludlow, of “Poor Men.” On the other hand, the Town Guild, or Merchant Guild,
contained all the wealthier traders in the town. Sometimes it happened that men
of different trades belonged to the same Guild. Thus Chaucer:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“An Haberdasher and a Carpenter</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">A webbe, a Deyer, and a Tapiser,</div>

   <div class="verse indent2">Of a solempne and grete fraternite.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="caption">From Zeller’s <cite>La France Anglaise et Charles VII.</cite></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the Guilds were very popular, and had an immense roll of members.
That of the Corpus Christi, York, is said to have numbered more than 14,000 members.
Its popularity, however, is accounted for on the ground of the important part it took
in the pageants of the City. The members took an oath of obedience on entrance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
There was an entrance fee and an annual subscription of “housefee,” the amount
varying from place to place, and from time to time. There were also calls upon the
members for burials or for help in case of a member falling into poverty, and there
were legacies. There were special days appointed for meeting together; the
members were summoned by the Dean or by the common bellman. On the day of
meeting they appointed officers, made agreements, and did other necessary things.
On one day in the year, their Saint’s day, they all put on red hoods and livery,
assembled together, marched to Church, bearing
wax tapers, heard mass, made offerings, and
going to the Guild house, or to the house of a
brother, they feasted together in love and good
fellowship.</p>

</div>

<p>On this day the richer Guilds got up processions,
shows, ridings, pageants, and miracle
plays. The internal administration of the Guilds
was by a Master—“Gruuman” or Alderman,
stewards or warders, Dean, and Clerk, the two
latter being paid officers. Every Guild had its
own livery. Those Guilds which were purely
religious were, like the Corpus Christi of York,
whose purpose was the conduct of a great and
solemn procession, to celebrate one of the most important of Church doctrines.
There were also Guilds for the performance of religious plays, as the Guilds
of St. Elene, of St. Mary, and Corpus Christi at Beverley. There were Guilds
for the repair of bridges and the building of chapels. There were Guilds of
priests, especially the wide-spread Guild of Kalenders, so called because they,
the members, met on the Kalend or first of every month. This Guild in some
places, as at Bristol, maintained a school. Other Guilds, as that of St. Nicholas
in Worcester, and that of Ludlow, maintained schools. All these Guilds were
eventually swept away with the Dissolution of the Religious Houses.</p>

<p>II. The second kind of Guild was the old Saxon Frith Guild. There remains
the complete code of a Frith Guild of the reign of Athelstan. In this</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“May be recognised a distinct attempt on the part of the public authorities to supplement the
defective execution of the law by measures for mutual defence ... if it be indeed the act of a voluntary
association, it forms a serious precedent for the action of the Germanic leagues and the Castilian

<p>After the ordinary rules of the Religious Guild there follow others connected
with the distinct objects of the Society. Every member pays fourpence, which constitutes
an insurance against theft; the Guild provides one shilling toward the
pursuit of the thief. The members are arranged in bodies of ten, one of whom is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
head man; these again are classed in tens under a common leader, who, with the
other head man, acts as treasurer and adviser of the hundred members. The objects
of the Society are the pursuit and capture of criminals and the exacting of compensation.
As regards the body called the Cnihten Guild, it is dealt with elsewhere.</p>

<p>III. We next come to the Merchant Guild. This was simply the whole body
of merchants organised for regulation of trade. In a
mercantile city such a Society would of course be
extremely powerful.</p>

<p>The statutes of the London Guilds were reduced
to writing in the time of King Athelstan. From them
Brentano thinks that the Guilds in and about London
were united into one Guild, and to have framed
common regulations for the better maintenance of
peace, for the suppression of violence—especially of
theft, and the aggressions of the powerful families,—as
well as for carrying out rigidly the ordinances
enacted by the King for that purpose.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that there are grave
difficulties concerning the Merchant Guild of London.
We find all the other towns in the country petitioning
for the Merchant Guild unless they have already such
an institution. But there are no documents at all
which show the operation or the functions of the
Merchant Guild of London. Some historians are of
opinion that the Merchant Guild ruled the whole
trade of the City, and that it was a body apart from
the Portreeve or the Mayor and his Aldermen.</p>

<p>Whatever it was before the creation of the
Mayor, there can be no doubt that after that important
step all the functions of a Merchant Guild
were discharged by the Mayor and Aldermen. These
functions were, in brief, the regulation of trade. Now,
in Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite> we have a great number of trades approaching the Mayor
and Aldermen with petitions not to regulate their trade for themselves; but that the
Mayor and Aldermen would be pleased to regulate it in a certain manner; to bestow
upon them certain powers; and to allow them to hale offenders, not before any
court of their own, but before the Mayor and Aldermen. What is this but the
authority of the Merchant Guild?</p>

<p>We have seen the rules of the Religious Guild. Let us now consider the
ordinances submitted to the Mayor and Aldermen by a Craft Company. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
following are those of the Pewterers. They are not the Articles of Association
framed when the Company was founded, but the rules by which the Company
regulated its own work:—</p>

<p>“Unto the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London pray the good folks,
makers of vessels of pewter in the same City, that it may please them to hear the
state and the points of their trade; and as to the defaults, for the common profit, by
good discretion to provide redress and amendment thereof; and the points which
are proper for folks who are skilful in the trade, and are duly ordained, to support
and maintain.</p>

<div class="caption">COOPERS’ MARKS, A.D. 142O<br />

</div>

<p>In the first place—seeing that the trade of pewtery is founded upon certain
matters and metals, such as copper, tin, and lead, in due proportions; of which three
metals they make vessels, that is to say, pots, salt-cellars, <i lang="fr">esquelles</i>,<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> <i>platers</i>, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
things by good folks bespoken; which works demand certain mixtures and certain
alloys, according to the manner of vessel so bespoken; the which things cannot be
made without good knowledge of a pewterer, well taught and well informed in the
trade; seeing that many persons, not knowing the right alloys, nor yet the mixtures
or the right rules of the trade, do work and make vessels and other things not in
due manner, to the damage of the people, and to the scandal of the trade; the good
folks of the trade do pray therefore that it may be ordained that three or four of the
most lawful and most skilful in the trade may be chosen to oversee the alloys and
the workmanship aforesaid; and that by their examination and assay, amendment
may speedily be made where default has been committed. And that if any one shall
be found rebellious against the Wardens and Assayers, the default may be shown,
with the name of the rebellious offender, unto the Mayor and Aldermen; and that by
them he may be adjudged upon, in presence of the good folks of the trade, who
have found such default. And be it understood, that all manner of vessels of pewter,
such as <i lang="fr">esquelles</i>, salt-cellars, platters, chargers, <i>pichers</i> squared, and <i>cruetz</i> squared,
and chrismatories, and other things that are made square or ribbed, shall be made of
fine pewter, with the proportion of copper to the tin as much as, of its own nature,
it will take. And all other things that are wrought by the trade, such as pots
rounded, <i>cruetz</i> rounded, and candlesticks and other rounded vessels that belong to
the trade, ought to be wrought of tin alloyed with lead in reasonable proportions.
And the proportions of alloy are, to one hundred weight of tin 22 pounds of lead;
and these are always called ‘vessels of pewter.’ Also, that no person shall intermeddle
with the trade aforesaid, if he be not sworn before the good folks of the trade
lawfully to work according to the points ordained; such as one who has been an
apprentice, or otherwise a lawful workman known and tried among them. And
that no one shall receive an apprentice against the usage of the City. And those
who shall be admitted therein, are to be enrolled, according to the usage of the City.</p>

<p>Also—that no person, freeman, or stranger, shall make or bring such manner of
vessel of pewter into the City for sale, or offer it for sale, before that material has
been assayed, on peril of forfeiture of the wares. And if the material be allowable
upon assay by the Wardens made, then let the wares be sold for such as they are
and not otherwise. And that no one of the trade shall make privily in secret vessels
of lead, or of false alloy, for sending out of the City to fairs and to markets for sale,
to the scandal of the City, and the damage and scandal of the good folks of the
trade; but let the things be shown, that shall be so sent to sell without the City, to
the Wardens of the trade before. And no one shall do any work in the trade, if he
will not answer as to his own workmanship, upon the assay of his work, in whatever
hand it be found. And if any one shall be found from henceforth carrying such wares
for sale, to fairs or to markets, or elsewhere in the kingdom, before it has been
assayed, and, before the Mayor and Aldermen, shall be convicted thereof, let him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
have his punishment at their discretion, according to his offence, when he shall be
so convicted at the suit of the good folks of his trade.</p>

</div>

<p>Also—if any one shall be found doing damage to his master, whether apprentice
or journeyman, privily in the way of larceny, under the value of ten pence, the first
time, let amends be made unto the master by him or by his surety in the trade; and
if he offend a second time, let his punishment be inflicted by award of the trade; and
if he offend a third time, let him be ousted from the trade.</p>

<p>Also—as to those of the said trade who shall be found working in the trade
otherwise than is before set forth, and upon assay shall be found guilty thereof; upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the first default let them lose the material so wrought; upon the second default let

<p>And also—the good folks of the trade have agreed that no one shall be so daring
as to work at night upon articles of pewter; seeing that they have regard among
themselves to the fact that the sight is not so profitable by
night, or so certain as by day—to the profit that is, of the
community. And also—that if any one of the said trade
shall be found in default in any of the points aforesaid, he
shall pay forty pence for the first default; for the second,
half a mark; and on the third default, let it be done with
him at the discretion of the Mayor and Aldermen; and of
these payments let there be given one-half to the Chamber,
to maintain the points aforesaid, and the other half to the
Wardens of the said trade, for their trouble and their
expenses. And that no one of the trade, great or small,
shall take away the journeyman of another man, against
the assent and the will of his first master, before he shall
have fully served his term, according to the covenant made
between them, and before the said journeyman shall have
made amends to his master for the offences and misprisions
committed against him, if he has in any way so offended or misprised, at the
discretion of the Wardens of their trade; and whosoever shall do to the contrary of
this ordinance, let such person have his punishment at the discretion of the Mayor
and Aldermen.</p>

<p>Also—that no one of the said trade shall be so daring as to receive any one to
work at the same trade, if he have not been an apprentice or if he be not a good
workman and one who can have the testimony of his master, or of good folks of good
condition; and can show that well and lawfully he has served his trade for the time
assigned among them. There were chosen and sworn to oversee the Articles aforesaid—Stephen
Lestraunge and John Syward, <i lang="fr">peautrers</i>.</p>

<p>On Thursday next after the feast of Allhallows (1st November) in the 23rd
year of the reign of King Edward the Third, etc., it was witnessed before Walter
Turk, Mayor, and the Aldermen, that Stephen Lestraunge was dead, and that John
Syward could not work; wherefore the reputable men of that trade chose Nicholas
de Ludgate and Ernald Schipwaysshe, pewterer, who were sworn to keep the
Articles aforesaid.” (Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite>, p. 241.)</p>

<p>These are the main points. No one can complain that they are drawn up in the
interests of the masters only. It is, however, to be remarked that the regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of wages, hours, and prices is not attempted. The omission was doubtless designed
as leaving such points fluctuating from day to day by arrangement between
masters and men.</p>

<p>In the chapter on City Factions it is shown that, a hundred years before the
date of their ordinances (1348), Thomas FitzThomas, the Mayor, had allowed the
trades to draw up statutes for themselves, and had given them Charters which
the following Mayors disallowed. These statutes, we are told in contemporary
authority, had caused “intolerable loss” to merchants frequenting London. It is
reasonable to conclude that they were drawn up by, and in the interests of, the
craftsmen, and not by those who were able to take a wider view of trade than
protection and high wages.</p>

<p>I have drawn up a list of the trades whose ordinances, as given by Riley, were
submitted to the Mayor and Aldermen in the fourteenth century, with the dates of
the regulations so drafted, and the subsequent date of the corporation as claimed by
the present companies.</p>

<p>This document, like others in Riley’s <cite>Memorials</cite>, is most interesting as marking
a definite stage. The trades have now learned, after a great deal of quarrelling,
vague jealousies and suspicions, to formulate what they call the “points” of their
craft. That their careful and judicious regulations, such as those I have quoted,
were drawn up by the leading men of the craft, the masters and employers, cannot
be doubted. They are not the work of ignorant men: they bear the impress of
shrewd and experienced employers, whose conclusions and recommendations were
drawn up for them by clerks skilled in the arrangement.</p>

<p>What is it that the Pewterers ask?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. That the Mayor and Aldermen will consider the points of their trade,
and that they will provide redress for faults.</p>

<p>Observe that they have no authority of their own such as they afterwards
obtained as a company.</p>

<p>2. An assay of the material.</p>

<p>3. Admission, by apprenticeship, “according to the usage of the
City.”</p>

<p>4. Protection against “foreigners,” <i>i.e.</i> persons not freemen of the
City.</p>

<p>5. No secret profits by making vessels of false alloy for export to country
fairs and markets.</p>

<p>6. The responsibility of every workman for his own work.</p>

<p>7. Penalties for damaging a master’s goods and for infringing the rules of the
craft.</p></blockquote>

<p>The triumph of the crafts was completed in the reign of Edward the Third. At
the same time it was a triumph which needed constant watchfulness. This necessity
is shown by the case of the rich Pepperers, who seceded in 1345 and set up a
company of their own. They were so rich that they commanded the Market. A
petition was presented to the King complaining that—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Great mischief had newly arisen, as well to the King as to the great men and commons, from the
merchants called Grocers (grossers), who engrossed all manner of merchandize vendible, and who suddenly
raised the prices of such merchandize within the realm; putting to sale by covin, and by ordinances
made amongst themselves, in their own society, which they call ‘the Fraternity and Gild of Merchants,’
such merchandizes as were most dear, and keeping in stores the others until times of dearth and scarcity.”
(L. Brentano, <cite>History and Development of Gilds</cite>, 1870.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It was, therefore, ordered that in future all “artificers and people of mysteries”
should choose each his own mystery, and should then practise no other.</p>

<p>What was the power of the incorporated Company? The keynote of the
difference between the Company and the Fraternity was that the former had
authority and the latter had none.</p>

<p>By their new powers, the Companies took over into their own hands the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
complete control of their trade. Henceforth the function of the Mayor was to
compose disputes and settle differences between the Companies, especially in those
cases where trades overlapped. The wardens, or the master and wardens, called
meetings of the Livery; at these meetings regulations were passed; it was the
duty of the wardens to enforce the execution of their own laws. They had the
right, which the Fraternities had obtained of the Mayor, to examine the work and
to destroy all that was “false.” In all matters concerning the Guild the master
and wardens formed the only court: there was no Court of Appeal; their decision
was final. There were certain exceptions to their power; the Mayor and Aldermen
kept in their own hands the sale and the price of bread, meat, drink and fuel. The
punishments were, for light offences, fines, either of money, of wax, or of beer and
wine. For serious offences expulsion from the Guild was the worst and last
punishment. A man so expelled could not any longer practise his trade in the City.
We hear also of ’prentices being flogged for acts of dishonesty or immorality.
Every man who practised any trade in the City must needs belong to the Company
of this trade. There would have been no power, otherwise, to enforce their laws.
What would be the good of calling order for the execution of good work if a colony
of workmen set up in the City and refused to obey those laws or to enter their
company? It was for self-preservation that this rule was enforced. Afterwards
it became a weapon of oppression when the number of members was limited.</p>

<p>The care with which the Companies provided for good work was equalled by
the jealousy with which they regarded the admission of new members. They
looked to the moral character of a workman as well as his mastery over the craft.
They made him serve an apprenticeship varying from seven to ten years. They
received the boy in a manner calculated to impress upon his mind the importance
of the duties upon which he was entering. At the close of his time he was, with
like solemnity, received as a member of the Company, and, therefore, a free man of
the City.</p>

<p>Next to looking after the young men, the Company looked after the tools.
These were to be inspected regularly; they were to be “testified as good and
honest.” The hours were fixed: no one was to work longer than from the
beginning of the day till curfew, nor at night by candle-light. One Company, that
of the weavers, forbade any work between Christmas and the Purification (Feb. 2).
No one was to work on Sunday, or on festivals, or on the eve of a double
feast, or on Saturday afternoons. The working men lost their Saturday half-holiday
by the Reformation; it has taken them 300 years to get it back again.</p>

<p>As for the ordinances which regulated the conduct of members toward each
other, I may pass them over. They were wise; they did what was possible to
prevent over-reaching, underselling, taking good servants from a brother member,
selling to one member indebted to another member, and, in a word, creating and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
keeping alive the feeling of brotherhood. Provision was made for those who fell
into poverty. As long as any member remained out of work no member was
allowed to employ any non-member; and the wife and children of a member might
work at the trade with the husband or the father.</p>

</div>

<p>In course of time, very speedily in fact, abuses crept in. The trades began to
limit the number of members; the richer members seceded and formed other
companies—the shoemakers left the cobblers, the tanners left the shoemakers;
masters withheld their wages from the workmen; journeymen were not allowed to
work on their own account; nor could they become masters; there were strikes
among the men, especially in the building trade; the journeymen formed companies
of their own which they used for the purpose of raising wages; in the year 1383 a
proclamation forbade the combination of workmen. Among the combinations so
suppressed were those of the “yomen” saddlers and the “yomen” tailors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>The ground thus cleared, the masters could use the Companies entirely for
their own profit and advantage. They endeavoured more and more to restrict the
number of members, and to make the handicrafts of London the monopoly of a few
families; in this attempt they were only too successful; in the sixteenth century Bacon
calls the City Companies “fraternities of evil.” The masters made the apprentices
swear that they would not carry on trade on their own account without the masters’
consent. The weakness of the law is shown in the failure of Henry’s law (1537);
fixing the entrance fee of an apprentice at 2s. 6d., it rose to 40s., to £10; in the time
of James the First to £20, £60, and £100; and in 1720 to £500 and more.</p>

<p>As to the further degeneration and the final ruin of the Craft Guilds, I refer
again to Luigo Brentano.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“As the Craft-Gilds everywhere had sunk down to mere societies for the investment of capital, and
as their dividends depended entirely on the exclusion of competition, it was unavoidable that the spirit
of gain should lead them to restrictions which became always more oppressive for the public. The
annoyances they caused were considerably increased by a process which, after the sixteenth century, was
of frequent occurrence in all countries; those Craft-Gilds namely, which had hitherto comprised kindred
crafts, split up into several, according to the individual trades. These then watched each other with the
utmost jealousy in order to prevent encroachments on their mutual rights, and continually fought each
other in endless lawsuits. Thus, for instance, the Fletchers and Bowyers in London separated themselves
into two corporations in the reign of Elizabeth. One might wonder that, on the one hand, the workmen,
whose position was so much deteriorated by the degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, did not at once overthrow
their dominion, as the Craft-Gilds had formerly superseded the degenerated Gilds of the patricians, and
that, on the other hand, the State did not, in the interest of the public, take any steps towards the abolition
of the Gilds, which had already been desired so often. But as to the working-men, though their position,
and especially their prospects, had been greatly deteriorated by this degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, their
interest was rather a reformation, than the abolition, of those bodies. The Craft-Gilds maintained a
number of regulations, which protected the working-men, and in consequence of which their material
position appears comfortable and free from cares, if compared with that of the factory hands at the
beginning of this century, when these regulations no longer existed. Uprisings of working-men are therefore
to be found in those days only in consequence of infringements of Gild-regulations. But as for a
reformation of the Craft-Gilds according to the interests of the working-men, the latter were not powerful
enough to carry it out against their masters. These still held strongly together in their Gilds, and did not
yet, as in later times (and as formerly the patricians), rival each other in weakening competition. The State
also had changed, and no longer consisted, as before, of an organisation of many smaller states. As, after
the sixteenth century, the State became in all countries continually more centralised by its kinds, it was
not possible for the journeymen to act with the same facility as the craftsmen had acted in former times in
the towns. Moreover, owing to the men’s isolated method of working, they had not yet acquired the same
feeling of solidarity, or the same consciousness of the power of masses, as our factory hands since have.
And as to the State abolishing the Craft-Gilds, Kings used the bourgeoisie as a support; first, as Henry
VII. in England, against the nobility; and then, because they needed them for pecuniary reasons....
The causes of the overthrow of the Craft-Gilds arose in the bourgeoisie itself. These causes were, the
rise of large capital, and its investment in manufacture. The 2nd and 3rd Philip and Mary already
indicates the commencement. After stating that ‘the rich clothiers do oppress the weavers, some by
setting up and keeping in their houses divers looms, and maintaining them by journeymen and other
persons unskilful; some by engrossing of looms into their hands, and letting them out at such unreasonable
rents as the poor artificers are not able to maintain themselves by, and much less their wives and
families; some again by giving less wages for the workmanship of cloth than in times past, whereby they
are forced utterly to forsake their occupations, etc.; it is enacted that no clothier, living out of a city,
burgh, or market-town, shall keep more than two looms, nor more than two apprentices,’ etc. In short, the
Act endeavours to protect the small masters against the competition of the rich capitalists. But neither
this Act nor all the other attempts of the corporations could restrain the process of development, which,
especially in consequence of a series of technical discoveries, threw manufacture altogether into the hands
of the large capitalists. Handicrafts, and the corporations together with them, lost continually in importance,
and only made themselves hated and despised in their endeavour to arrest the natural progress
of event.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us sum up the origin and development of the Guild.</p>

<p>1. We have the family united for the protection of all its members, standing by
each other, liable for each other.</p>

<p>2. Next we have the association of neighbours together, of many families, to
form guilds of religion and brotherly love and mutual protection.</p>

<p>3. The crafts are found uniting for trade purposes, regulating the production,
jealously watching the standards of work, fixing hours of work and prices, excluding
foreigners, and importing raw material. These trade unions had no powers other
than those obtained by common agreement.</p>

<p>4. The formation of a Merchant Guild.</p>

<p>5. The rise of a City aristocracy who usurp the power, own the City land,
impose taxes, and are insolent towards the craftsmen.</p>

<p>6. The revolt of the crafts against the aristocracy and their ultimate victory
after a long struggle.</p>

<p>7. The creation of trade or craft companies, not guilds, solely for trade
purposes, under ordinances approved by the Mayor.</p>

<p>8. The conquest of power by the new companies.</p>

<p>9. The complete subjection of the craftsmen for five hundred years to their
own companies.</p>

<small>THE RELIGIOUS LIFE</small></h3>


<p>If churches and religious houses make up religion, then London of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries surely attained the highest point ever reached in religion. The
Church was everywhere. In Appendices IV. and V. will be found a list of the Parish
Churches and their patronage. The abbeys, priories, nunneries, and friaries contained
a vast army of ecclesiastics from archbishop to Franciscan friar: hermits,
anchorites, pardoners, limitours, somnours, church officers of all kinds, were everywhere
in evidence. No street but reminded the citizens by the sight of a spire or
a wall, that the Church was with him always, to rule his life and to shorten his period
of purgatory, on the simple condition of his obedience. Religion endeavoured to rule
the whole of society: religion claimed to control the whole conduct of politics and
political economy: but the power of religion has never been equal to her ambition:
religion could not put a stop to war, or to the violences and outrages of war. Had
she been able to do so, the world would now be held and bound in chains and slavery.
Yet it was well that there should be the Church to restrain men in some degree.
She kept in her own hands, so far, all learning, all science, all the arts, all the professions.
The forms, duties, and rules of the Church attended all men from infancy
to the grave. At the bidding of the Church the whole nation, from the King
downwards, renounced meat for a fourth part of the whole year. This fact alone
marks the enormous power of the Church. For hundreds of years the Church
preached respect for human life and self-restraint with more or less vigour, and
with more or less success. Sometimes the Church has fallen upon evil times;
her ecclesiastics have been ambitious, worldly, licentious, avaricious; but they
have always been, as a whole, superior to the world around them. Thus it may
be said that the Church might always have been better, but that the world was
always worse.</p>

<p>Let us, then, briefly examine into what was meant by the Religious Life of
London in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>There were a hundred and twenty-six parish churches in London. This
seems an enormous number for a population of not more than 120,000 or thereabouts.
But we have to remember what the Church did for the people. The daily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
services; the chanting of the daily masses for living and for dead; the funerals, the
weddings, the baptisms, the visitation of the sick, the direction of Fraternities, the
countless observances and customs of religion, for all these things the Church was
the centre, and the parish clergy were the directors.</p>

<p>The boundaries of a parish were not at first rigidly laid down; they overlapped
the ward boundaries; they were matters of agreement: it was not until the Poor
Law made the definition necessary, that the boundaries were finally and exactly
laid down.</p>

<p>The multiplication of parishes was partly due, no doubt, to the desire of
expiating sins by building, endowing, and decorating a Church for the good of the
Founder’s soul. The census of the City, taken at any time between the ninth and the
fifteenth centuries, would certainly show an almost stationary figure, lowered upon a
visitation of plague, or raised after a long interval without plague, pestilence, fire, or
famine. The average represented about a thousand souls to every church. The
origin of the City churches cannot, as a rule, be ascertained. The oldest dedications
of the churches seem to show that the London parishes were settled before the
Norman Conquest: most of the London churches were probably built in or about
the eighth century during that strange outburst of religious enthusiasm, the first of
so many which have swept over the country.</p>

<p>London was a city of churches: one could not escape the sight of the green
churchyard, the trees standing over the graves, and the little church among them.
Nor could one get away from the sound of the church bells. All day long, from
daybreak until night, the bells were ringing, not only from the churches, but also
from the monastic houses. High above the stroke of anvil, and the multitudinous
roar of the industrial city, rolled and clanged and resounded the continual clash of
the bells. What the boy Whittington heard at Highgate was not the chime of Bow
Church alone; it was the sound of the bells of all the churches and all the convents
of London ringing together.</p>

<p>I have estimated roughly that, with the parish churches and their property,
a full quarter of the City was occupied by the religious houses and the places
they owned. As for the proportion of the population which was supported
by the Church, we may form an idea by taking the case of St. Paul’s Cathedral
alone:—</p>

<p>In the year 1450 the Society, a Cathedral body, included the following: the
Bishop, the Dean, the four Archdeacons, the Treasurer, the Precentor, the
Chancellor, thirty greater Canons, twelve lesser Canons, about fifty Chaplains or
chantry Priests, and thirty Vicars. Of inferior rank to these were the Sacrist and
three Vergers, the Succentor, the Master of the Singing-school, the Master of the
Grammar-school, the Almoner and his four Vergers, the Servitors, the Surveyor, the
twelve Scribes, the Book Transcriber, the Book-binder, the Chamberlain, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Rent-Collector, the Baker, the Brewer, the Lavenders (washermen), the Singing-men
and Choir Boys, of whom priests were made, the Bedesmen, and the poor folk.
To these must be added the servants of all these officers—the brewer, who
brewed, in the year 1286, 67,814 gallons, must have employed a good many; the
baker, who ovened every year 40,000 loaves, or every day more than a hundred
large and small; the sextons, grave-diggers, gardeners, bell-ringers, makers and
menders of the ecclesiastical robes, cleaners and sweepers, carpenters, masons,
painters, carvers, and gilders—one can very well understand that the Church of St.
Paul’s found a livelihood for a thousand at least.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig-33"></a>
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="right"><small><i>The Photochrom Co. Ltd.</i></small></p>
<p class="center">ST. ETHELBURGA’S CHURCH, BISHOPSGATE STREET</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same equipment was necessary in every other religious foundation. Not a
monastery but had its great and lesser officers and their servants. In every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
there were the bell-ringers, the singing-men and boys, the vergers, the gardeners,
the brewers, bakers, cooks, messengers, scribes, rent-collectors, and all of them
were complete in themselves, as was St. Paul’s, though on a smaller scale. Then
if we consider the Parish Churches. In some cases two priests were attached to
each Church for the daily services: if there were, say, fifteen chantries, and in
some there were many more, belonging to each, we have over 2000 priests for
the parish churches alone; there were, next, the people belonging to each church:
the choir, the sacrist, the organist, the beadle, the sexton, the anchorite or ankress,
say an average, in all, of a hundred, including the families of those who were married.
This makes some 12,000 souls living upon the endowments and revenues of the
City Churches.</p>

<p>If there were eighty monks at St. Peter’s, Westminster, there were at least a
hundred people, all of them married and with families, in their service. Now there
were, large and small, about twenty-five Religious Houses in and outside London.
If we take an average of seventy people of various trades attached to and living
by each House, and an average of thirty brethren and sisters, we have nearly 7000
people belonging to them. To sum up, therefore, there were nearly 20,000 people
in the City of London and its suburbs engaged in working for, and living by,
the Churches and the Religious Houses. About one-fifth of the population of
London lived by the Church. This is a moderate estimate. The proportion
of ecclesiastics and their servants to the general population was probably much
higher.</p>

<p>The Bishop, in the eyes of London, was the greatest person in the country next
to the King: he lived among the people and was their natural protector: he had his
Palace within the precinct, in the north-west of the Cathedral; he attended the
Church on all the great Festivals—Christmas, Easter, Ascension, Whitsunday, the
Festivals of St. Paul and St. Erkenwald, and also on Maundy Thursday and Ash
Wednesday (see Appendix VI.). He observed the greatest state possible when
he rode forth: there went with him, as he journeyed from one to the other
of his country houses, forty persons at least, including his squires, his chaplains,
the young monks entrusted to his care, and his servants: he was profuse in
charity: he was stately in his carriage and splendid in his dress. As in the
days of William the Conqueror, so in those of Edward the Third, the Bishop
of London, with the Mayor, stood for the City, but the Mayor stood behind
the Bishop.</p>

<p>The Cathedral, in the midst of the City, belonged to all alike: its splendid
services, the singing of the choir, the rolling of the organ, the procession of priests
with their white and gold copes, the ringing of the bell every day seven times from
daybreak till curfew for as many services, the shrines of the saints, flaming with gold
and precious stones and rich embroideries, especially those of St. Erkenwald, St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Ethelburga, and St. Mellitus, all these things appealed to the citizen and kept him
loyal to the faith.</p>

<div class="caption">THE MONK AND HIS GREYHOUNDS</div>
</div>

<p>There were, after the Cathedral dignitaries, the parish priests and the chantry
priests, with the great army of those who lived by the altar; the anchorites and the
hermits, the monks and friars, the nuns and sisters, all the people who formed the
service of the monastic houses, the hospitals for the sick, the houses for the insane,
the lepers’ houses, the schools, and the colleges. The last named were not places
of education, but colleges of priests, of which All Souls, Oxford, and the College
of Dulwich are two survivals. In London there were the Colleges of St. Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
of Acon, in Cheapside, where is now Mercers’ Hall; that of St. Spirit and St.
Mary founded by Whittington for a Master and four Fellows with clerks, conducts,
choristers, and an almshouse; St. Michael’s, Crooked Lane, for a Master and
nine Fellows; Jesus’ Commons for priests; and St. Augustine’s Papey for old
and infirm priests. Quiet and pleasant places all, where life gently glided along;
where there were no duties but the daily mass, no Rule, no Austerities—the ideal
life for the scholar among the books of the library; and for those who loved to
sit apart and meditate among the trees and flower-beds of the garden in summer,
or in the glazed cloisters sheltered from the cold wind and frost of winter. Outside,
in the work-a-day world, what did the people think and believe? The history
of religion, or of religious thought, in London, cannot be separated from that of
the whole country. It is a history of enthusiasms in successive waves. When the
whole of England—in the eighth century—understood, with a new and overwhelming
sense, the reality of Christianity; when Kings and Queens, Earls and Thanes and
noble ladies crowded into the monasteries, there to prepare for the next world,
compared with which this present world is not worth considering, then the people
of London for their part rebuilt the Abbey of Westminster, and founded the House
of St. Martin-le-Grand; they divided London into parishes and erected parish
churches; they created guilds for the spiritual nourishment of those who could not
enter the Religious House.</p>

<p>During the two hundred years of struggle with the Danes and Normans, these
Houses were destroyed, or, if they survived, were carried on with fewer brethren
and a more slender endowment.</p>

<p>When order returned, and a strong King made it possible for men to live
without the weapons of war at hand, the mind of the people, always a profoundly
religious people, turned again to the realities of the unseen world. Once more
there awakened the sense of change and decay and the worthlessness of things
fleeting. The Court Jesters—converted—founded hospitals; the City Fathers
handed over the lands of the City to the newly founded House of the Holy Trinity.
Monasteries, nunneries, and colleges sprang up everywhere. The new foundations
satisfied the people for another hundred years or so. Then they woke up once
more in the old way. The religious life, they discovered, is not always found in
the Religious House; the hood does not make the monk. The Friars came over
to the country; they showed the people a new kind of religious life; one not
separated from the world, but moving and living in the world; one that saves the
soul by losing it and mounts to Heaven by the prayers and gratitude of men and
women whom it has lifted from the mire and slough of sin and disease and misery.
No more noble form of Christianity can be presented. Francis discovered the
very mind of the Founder.</p>

<p>For a hundred years and more the Friars kept alive the new religion. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
fell off; but their early teaching survived, and was the foundation of Lollardy.
When the Religious Houses were suppressed, the people of London looked on
without a protest; their work was done; the City was again waking up to a new
enthusiasm. The Reformation, the many sects of the new Faith, the fanaticism of
the seventeenth century, the enthusiasm of the eighteenth, the Evangelical domination,
the return of High Church doctrine, the development of Ritual, all these things
are but manifestations of the same spirit which caused the Revival under Henry
the Fourth and the Puritanism of the Civil Wars. Many changes pass over the
face of London, but deep down lies, unchanged, the ancient spirit of religion.</p>

<div class="caption">CHANTRY CHAPEL OF HENRY V. IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY<br />
From Grangerised Edition of Brayley’s <cite>London and Middlesex</cite> in Guildhall Library.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>In the Parish Church, generally a small building erected by some citizen who
got a bit of the City carved out for his parish, there was little splendour. Every day
mass was said in the morning, and vespers in the evening, by the Parish Priest:
every morning the Chantry priests before the side altars sang mass for the souls
of their founders. On All Souls’ Day the Parish Priest sang mass for the souls of
all Christian men and women. There was many a poor faithful woman who could
not find the money to pay for a Chantry or an obit, or an Annual, for the soul of
her husband or her son—though well she knew, poor creature, how much he wanted
that assistance. But she took comfort in the thought that so long as the world
should last that yearly mass would be said for the benefit of all poor souls in pain.</p>

<p>The endowment of a Chantry generally provided for one priest, but often for
two, in some cases for three, and in one, that of Adam de Bury in 1364, for seven
priests. In the fourteenth century there were more than 70 chantries in St. Paul’s
alone. There were also 111 obits or foundations for occasional masses—making
altogether an income of £183: 18: 3-1/2.</p>

<p>In the reign of Richard the Second, Bishop Braybroke found that some of
the chantries had fallen into decay, the endowments having been lost or wasted.
He united some of the poorer ones. He also ordained that no beneficed priest
should hold a chantry, and laid down regulations for the chantry priests. They
were to attend the choir offices day and night; they were to take part in processions,
funerals, and they were to live in Houses provided for them or in the chambers of
Chantries. These priests seem to have given a great deal of trouble by the scandals
which they caused. It must be remembered that they were not persons, as a rule,
of scholarly habits; that their sole duty consisted in the daily mass for the soul
of their Founder; and that they had the whole day to get through in idleness.
They were also extremely poor, the average stipend being £5 a year, equivalent
to something like £75. Archbishop Sudbury, in 1378, spoke of them in the strongest
terms of reproach, summing up his enumeration of their vices by saying that their
lives tended “in virorum ecclesiasticorum detestabile scandalum, et exemptum
perniciosissimum laicorum.”</p>

<p>It is not possible, I think, to make out how far the London craftsman assisted
at the Functions of the Church. At least once a year he must go to Confession.
The Pope made that rule in 1215. The craftsman probably went to Confession
at one of the greater festivals. Every Sunday morning he must be present at mass.
That duty was then, as now, imposed on every faithful child of the Church. This
law, doubtless, he did obey. There were dues to be paid: he had to pay them;
there were friars who came begging: he contributed of his poverty; and he must
fast in Lent and on Fridays and on certain other days—about a hundred days in
all. In this point he must needs obey, because the butchers’ shops were closed,
and he could buy no meat. He had to get married; to get the children baptized;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
to pay dues for the Vigil of the Dead. Another important function performed by
the clergy was the reconciliation of enemies and the settlement of disputes by
“love days.” There are many references to the love days. <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>
constantly talks about them, and with bitterness, as if the Church made the office
of Peacemaker a means of enriching herself. Riley quotes an ordinance forbidding
people to make disturbances by getting up love days.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND RECEIVING MASS<br />
Harl. MS. 1319.</div>
</div>

<p>The memory of one of these love days has been preserved ever since the
year 1484, when a dispute between two Companies of the City of London was finally
adjusted. It was on the 10th of April 1484 that the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen
decided a long-standing dispute between the Company of Merchant Taylors and
the Company of Skinners as follows:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>—“The said Mayor and Aldermen, the day
and year above said taking upon them the rule, direction, and charge of arbitrament
of, and in the premises, ‘for norishing of peas and love between the Masters
Wardeyns and Fellashipps aforesaid’ adjudged and awarded that the Masters and
Wardens should dine each year together at their respective Halls; the Taylors
with the Skinners on the Vigil of Corpus Christi; and the Skinners with the
Taylors on the Feast of Nativity of St. John Baptist; and as to precedency each
Company was to take that on each alternate year save that a Mayor of either should
give that Company precedence in his year of office.”</p>

<p>So the Decree has been observed 414 years, while “peas and love” have
reigned between the two Fellowships.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century we find the London clergy married, and married into
families of the highest position. Their marriage, therefore, was not looked upon by
the people, although forbidden by the Church, as in any way blameworthy. In the
Synod of 1108, and in that of 1125, both held in London, the most stringent rules
were laid down against the marriage of priests. The title of wife was denied their
wives, who were called concubines; yet the priests continued to marry. Even in
the sixteenth century, when Skelton took Sanctuary against the wrath of Wolsey,
he brought his wife and children with him.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century a renewed effort was made to enforce celibacy as
rigidly as could be done. The clergy of the towns, of London at least, were
compelled to keep celibate, but not those of the country where the arm of the
Bishop was weak. Holinshed, for instance, speaks of the methods adopted in the
year 1225 (ii. 358):—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>
<p>“This yeare also, there came foorth a decree from the archbishop of Canterburie,
and his suffragans, that the concubines of preests and clearkes within orders (for so
were their wives then called in contempt of their wedlocke) should be denied of
Christian buriall, except they repented whilest they were alive in perfect health,
or else showed manifest tokens of repentance at the time of their deaths. The
same decree also prohibited them from the receiving of the pax at masse time,
and also of holie bread after masse, so long as the preests kept them in their houses,
or used their companie publikelie out of their houses. Moreover, that they should
not be purified when they should be delivered of child, as other good women were,
unless they found sufficient suertie to the archdeacon, or his officiall, to make
satisfaction at the next chapter or court to be holden after they should be purified.
And the preests should be suspended, which did not present all such their concubines
as were residant within their parishes. Also, all such women as were convict to
have dealt carnallie with a preest were appointed by the same decree to doo open
penance. Where the question may be asked, whether this decree was extended
to preests’ wives or no? Whereunto answer may be made, that as a quadrangle
in geometrie compriseth in it a triangle, and a quaternion in arithmetic conteineth
a ternion; so in logike a universall proposition comprehendeth a particular. But
it is said here, that all such women as had carnal knowledge with a preest, were
to be punished, therefore some, and consequentlie all preests’ wives. But yet this
seemeth not to be the meaning of that decree, for preests were allowed no wives,
naie Sericius the pope judged that all such of the cleargie as had wives could not
please God, bicause they were in carne, which words he and the residue of that
litter restreined to marriage, admitting that in no case churchmen should injoy the
rights of matrimonie. Wherein they offer God great injurie, in seeking to limit
that large institution of wedlocke, wherein all estates are interressed.”</p>

<p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we find the natural harvest and fruit of
this enforced celibacy.</p>

<p>It is not my desire to bring railing accusations against the morals of the clergy.
It is, however, quite certain that if a large body of men without much learning or
love of learning, to whom is assigned work which occupies them for a very small
portion of the day, are forbidden to marry, and if they live for the most part among the
lower classes in the City, drinking freely, and as much as they can afford, the result
will be, must be, the prevalence of immorality among them. There are plenty of
examples and proofs of this condition of things. There is the case in 1385 of Elizabeth
Moring, who received girls nominally as apprentices, but really to live a lewd life,
and “to consort with friars, chaplains, and other such men.” In 1406 we read of one
William Langford, chaplain, taken in adultery with Margaret, wife of Richard Dod.
In 1255 a certain Chaplain and Parish Priest took Sanctuary in St. Paul’s and
confessed to having stolen sixteen silver dishes. In 1320 a Chaplain is taken up
for being a Night Walker and carrying arms against the peace. In 1416 William
Cratford, a priest, is reported as a common and notorious thief and hawker on the
roads. In 1408 Riley reports that the Letter Book about this time (Henry IV.-Henry
VI.) contains “some dozens of similar charges,” viz. of fornication and
adultery. The way they tried to check the vice and punish the offender was by
forbidding any one to pay or engage the incriminated clerk. This was done
in 1413, when two priests of St. Bride’s, Fleet Street, were taken in adultery at
the same time with two women in the Church. How far can William of Langland
be trusted in setting forth the truth without exaggeration? One knows not. In
<cite>Piers Plowman</cite>, however, the figure of Sloth is a priest. He confesses (Skeat’s
Edition, B. Passus v. p. 168):—</p>

<p>Many other things point to the scandalous lives of the religious. Thus, the
Bishop of Lincoln—not London,—in the reign of Henry III., visiting the religious
houses in his diocese, searched the bedrooms and the beds of the monks and friars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
and caused examination of the closest possible kind to be made in the nunneries.
This would hardly be done without grave suspicions and reports.</p>

<p>Another crying scandal in the Church was the appointment of foreigners to
high offices and benefices.</p>

<p>In the year 1245 an inventory was compiled of all benefices held by foreigners
and appointed by the Pope. It was found that the sum of 60,000 marks was
annually paid to these foreigners. This means almost a million of our money. The
bitterness that this caused was so strong that in many parts the people refused to pay
their tithe or their dues. There are other indications of hostility to the pretensions
of the Pope. A certain Carthusian of London was brought before the Legate for
teaching that Gregory was not the true Pope. The monks of Durham refused to
obey the Papal ordinance, which commanded every one who was appointed as Abbot
to proceed to Rome, there to receive the Pope’s blessing. And the Archbishop of
York, refusing to bestow the revenues of his diocese on Italians and foreigners, was
cursed by the Pope with bell, book, and candle. This resistance, however, was
before its time; it was, in fact, two hundred years too soon.</p>

<p>In the year 1222 we hear of certain cases of cruel death inflicted for religious
reasons. They did not occur in London, but at Oxford. A man was brought before
the Council at that City charged with personating Christ Himself—Holinshed says
two, but Matthew of Westminster says one, and it is impossible that two persons
should both at the same time pretend to be Christ. The impostor showed the
stigmata upon his hands and feet and in his side: he is said to have preached against
the abuses of the ecclesiastics. Indeed, there was never any time when these abuses
were more flagrant than in the reign of Henry the Third. The man was clearly an
enthusiast, one who had gradually become mad with religious fervour, until he
actually persuaded himself that he was the Christ whose religion he tried to preach.
The other was the enthusiast’s follower and disciple. With them were two women,—when
was there ever enthusiast without a pious woman at his side? One of these
poor creatures had been assured by the leader that she was the Virgin Mary, and the
other that she was Mary Magdalene. Both of them, of course, firmly believed the
assurance. The whole four were tried, the leader was actually crucified, in mockery
of his pretensions, and the women were “condemned,” most likely, to be burned.</p>

<p>Against these examples of crime and ignorance may be set the fact that there
was never any such violent and unanimous attack upon the secular clergy as we
find against the friars. And we may fairly conclude that Chaucer’s portrait of the
Parson was drawn from the life, and that there were among the London clergy
many who might have sat for models:—</p>

<p>Chaucer makes the wife of the miller of Trumpington daughter of a priest and
brought up in a nunnery. On this fact Skeat has a note<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of comment.</p>

<p>“The statement, that the parson of the town was her father, has caused surprise.
In Bell’s <cite>Chaucer</cite> the theory is started that the priest had been a widower before
he took orders, which no one can be expected to believe; it is too subtle. It is
clear that she was an illegitimate daughter; that is why her father paid money to
get her married to a miller, and why she thought ladies ought to spare her (and
not to avoid her), because it was an honour to have a priest for a father, and because
she had learnt so much good-breeding in a nunnery.”</p>

<p>The Religious Life of a Mediæval City largely consisted of the monastic life,
and this again was divided between the monks and the friars.</p>

<p>The references to Monks and Monkery in London are, on the whole, good-humoured,
from which we may infer that there was little in the way of serious
scandal as regards their lives. The easy-going citizens did not expect the most
ascetic life in the world from the monks and nuns, who were their own cousins,
brothers, or sisters; they recognised it, however, when they found it: for instance,
they held the Carthusians in the highest possible reverence, as a body of Religious
who adhered strictly to an austere Rule: never ate meat, and never went outside
the walls of the House. As regards the other monks, those of Holy Trinity, those
of St. Bartholomew’s, those of Westminster, those of St. Mary Overies, it seems
certain that they were latterly all of good family; that the austerity of the Rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
had been very much relaxed; that the life of the Monastery was, as a rule, decent
and dull; that it was very far from being conducive to the development of genius
or learning; that it offered place and encouragement to piety of the gentler as well
as the more austere kind; that it formed a home for younger sons; that it did
not provoke animosity or indignation among the citizens. The well-known case
of St. Alban’s, quoted by Froude,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> had it happened in London, would surely have
become known by the people. Chaucer, who reflects the general feeling, has no
bitterness at all towards the monk. He depicts him as fond of hunting; he is an
“out-rider,” one who can go abroad on the business of the House; he rides a
good horse—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“And whan he rood, men might his brydel here</div>
   <div class="verse">Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere</div>
   <div class="verse">And eek as loude as doth the Chapel belle.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He kept hounds; all his “lust” was in “priking and in hunting of the hare”; he
was dressed as a layman; he was fat and in good point; “he was not pale as a
for-pyned ghost,”—a picture of a man whose thoughts, indeed, were not wholly
set on things spiritual. Chaucer certainly compared the man with the austere
monk designed by the Rule he professed, but without bitterness. He grants
the old proverb,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“That a monk when he is cloistreless</div>
   <div class="verse">Is lykened til a fish that is waterless”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(a proverb also quoted by William of Langland), but in order to show that the
contemporary monk was not of that opinion he adds:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Thilke texte held he not worth an oistre.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rich clothing and unclerical garb of the monks outside the cloister, and
their fondness for hunting, are the principal charges brought against them in the
fourteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us consider the actual life of a monk, a Benedictine monk. To begin with,
it is a great mistake to suppose that an Abbey was always and for choice planted
in some remote and secluded spot. As the people of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries no more acted without good and sufficient cause than we their descendants,
there must have been a very good reason to justify the foundation of so many
Religious Houses within and without the walls of the City of London. Dear to
many were the quiet meadows beside the rushing stream, beneath the hanging
woods, far from the noise of men, of Tintern, of Fountains, of Dryburgh, or of
Blanchland: dearer to others the thought of the life close to those walls, which held
so much of violence, passion, ambition, and crime, which their very presence would
calm and shame and admonish; of the men broken and ruined, of the women
disgraced, to whom these quiet cloisters offered a resting-place; why, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
very worst, the most hardened of murderous ruffians, to such as Chaucer’s shipman,
pirate and murderer, the daily prospect of these walls, the ringing of the bells,
the voices chanting Litany and Laud, the sight of the friars going about among
them, the knowledge that these men and women lived in abstinence from all that
the world called pleasure; that they possessed no property; that they desired
none of the things which the world desires; this reflection, the obtrusion of these
facts, acted as a continual admonition and call to repentance. Of course there
was the danger, the continual danger, always present in human affairs, of the
relaxation of the Rule; the loss of the first enthusiasm; the decay of the first
intention. A Benedictine who rides abroad dressed like a knight with hawk
and hound, for whom a hundred manors send up their rent, their wheat and their
game; who keeps a splendid table; who admits to his order only young men well
born; to whom the place is like the College of All Souls, a House of Fellows
with no duties, ceases to be regarded with reverence on account of reputed piety.
When not even the memory is left of the early piety; when the air is thick with
stories of incontinence and greed; when the land is everywhere parcelled out
among the religious; then they become intolerable, and must be swept away. We
shall have to return to this subject. Meantime let us consider the monastic life
at a time when the monasteries were at their wealthiest, and when the ancient Rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
although very far relaxed, had not yet become an object of common contempt,
when the monks and friars had not yet quite fallen from their ancient reputation.
The time chosen for this view of the monastic life is that before the Wars of the
Roses, which greatly impoverished the Religious Houses and at the same time
deprived them of novices. Just as the first incursions of the Danes emptied the
Anglican and Saxon Monasteries, so the long Wars of the Roses called out the
younger as well as the elder sons to the wars. Now, by this time, the rich
monasteries were entirely recruited from the younger sons of the gentry. Great
nobles placed their children in monasteries. Thus, Ralph, Earl of Westmoreland,
had twenty children, and three of his daughters became nuns. Edward the Fourth
made one of his daughters a nun. One of the children of Owen Tudor and
Katherine of Valois was placed in Westminster Abbey as an infant, and there
remained for life as a monk. Edward the First had one daughter a nun. Thirteen
daughters of nobles were in Ambresbury at the same time. The fact that the
Abbey was for gentlefolk is clearly brought out by the list of names of the
Westminster monks given in the Podelicote case. This occurred in the year 1303.
It was the robbery of the royal Treasury or the Chapel of the Pyx at Westminster.
Here were kept many of the things required for the assay of new coins, and at the
time of the robbery the chapel contained an altogether unusual amount of specie,
about £100,000, equal to perhaps a million of money in our time. The robber was
Richard de Podelicote, who got into the Abbey from the palace, which, as the
king was away, was probably less strictly guarded than usual. He climbed
through one of the Chapter House windows, and so into the Refectory. He
carried away many of the silver cups and managed to escape safely. However,
he returned another time and attacked the Treasury. For this he had to cut
through solid stone walls, and conceal his work; night after night he returned, and
in his confession he makes no mention of any confederates. His perseverance was
successful, and he took the money and all the gold and silver things which could
be conveniently melted down away with him, but left behind the large jewels
that he could not easily have got rid of. However, the stuff was afterwards traced,
not only to Podelicote himself but to many others. Such is the story, and most
amazing it is. There is no doubt that the chief actors were hanged, though there
is no actual record of such a hanging. All the monks, forty of them, were sent
to the Tower, presumably for their carelessness in guarding the Treasury. They
were released after two years. In a letter from the king we have a record of
their names, and these names show almost in all cases gentle birth. In effect, it
wants no proof to understand that the desirable endowments of a Religious
House, whose Brethren were like the Fellows of a College richly founded,
would not be bestowed upon the children of rustics and servants. Here and
there, no doubt, a rustic’s son might get advancement by the promise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
exceptional ability; but this was in the ranks of the secular clergy rather than
in the Religious Houses. The future monk was brought in, appointed by
interest, as to a very good thing, when a boy. It was extremely difficult to
procure such an appointment.</p>

<p>Founder’s kin, Benefactor’s kin sometimes helped; generally it was by private
interest that lads were admitted as novices. The monks were not, as a rule,
anxious to enlarge their numbers: rather to keep them down, so that the revenues
of the House should provide amply for all. Sometimes admission was obtained
by gifts or the conveyance of land. I have said that during the Civil Wars the
number of monks decreased enormously; at Westminster it declined from eighty
to thirty; at Canterbury from a hundred and fifty to fifty-four; at Gloucester
from a hundred to thirty-six. This decrease was due, no doubt, partly to the
disastrous influence of the War on rents; partly to the demand for fighting men;
partly, I believe, to an increasing distaste for the monastic life. The child fortunate
enough to be appointed was formerly presented in the Church as a novice; his parents
first cut off his curls, offering his long hair to the Abbey. They then placed the
chalice and the Host in his hand and led him to the priest at the altar. Here
they wrapped his hands in the pall of the altar, and heard read a written engagement
that they would not tempt the boy from the House. After this the Abbot
consecrated a hood for the boy and laid it on him. He was then taken out, shaved
after the fashion of the Order, robed, and brought back, after which he was received
with prayers. It took long years to break in a novice, to teach him obedience, to
crush his will, to take the fighting spirit out of him, and the love instinct out of
him; in fact, if stories are true, the success of the system was often incomplete
in every point. The novice had to sit in silence for hours, with down-cast
eyes; he was never left alone to play at freedom; he had to do everything in a
manner prescribed by rule, even the lifting of a cup at meals, even the carriage
of the hands when seated; things had to be said in a certain form; services were
frequent, and the singing of Psalms went on all day long and half the night. The
Church ceremonies were involved and elaborate. By the time the novice was
admitted he already knew every Function in the book, and all the Psalms and
Prayers by heart. By this time, also, the House was all the world to him. What
went on outside he knew not, the House was everything—father, mother, brothers
and kin; he had no ambition except to rise to monastic honours. He had completed
his education. If he were a Benedictine, that education was liberal: he was taught
grammar, logic, Latin, philosophy, writing and illuminating, music, singing, and the
history of the Order. After his profession, the Benedictine theory was that he
continued his studies. If he did they were, in most of the English Houses, sterile
of results. At eighteen the novice made his profession. There was then no retreat
possible for him, he was a monk for life. At first he was a Junior, and as such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
he read the Gospel and the Epistle for the day; he carried a taper in processions;
he read the martyrology in the Chapter.</p>

<p>The services began at two in the morning with Matins; this finished, the Choir
went to bed; the rest sang Lauds for the dead; they went to bed again and slept till
daybreak or five, when they got up and had Prime; at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> there was Tierce;
at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> there was Sext; at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> there was Nones; at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> there were
Vespers. The monks went to bed at eight, having given up eight hours at least out
of the twenty-four to services in the church. Eight hours were spent in sleep.
One hour was spent in the daily gathering in the Chapter House, leaving seven for
meals, exercise, recreation, and study. The rules were in some cases relaxed for
scholars, but, even making allowance for such relaxation, it is clear that the monk,
who was a student, was at a great disadvantage compared with the student who
lived outside.</p>

<p>The church was, of course, the most important part of the buildings of a
monastery. South of the nave was the cloister, with its four walks, in which the
monks spent their time when not in church; on the east of the cloister was the
Chapter House; on the south, the Refectory; on the west, the Abbot’s House.
Beyond the cloister were the dormitories, the Scriptorium, the Misericordia, the
Infirmary, the Guest House. Beyond these were the Kitchen, Buttery, Pantry
cellars, Brewery, Bakehouse, Laundry, offices for making and mending, orchards,
gardens, vineyards, fishponds etc., and stables. An important House had a
great establishment to keep up. This was presided over in its various departments
by the Brethren themselves, whose offices will be enumerated presently. This
work occupied a good many of the Seniors. In fact there were so many offices
that it is difficult to discover how they could find time for purposes of study. If they
wanted to study, or if they wanted to meditate, there was the cloister, but no other
place. Desks were set out there; but as the novices’ school was also carried on
there with, as sometimes happened, mechanical work by some of the Brothers, it
would seem impossible, according to modern ideas, to carry on serious study amid
such interruptions. It is a commonplace to speak of the monotony of a Religious
House. Considering that most of the inmates knew no other kind of life, they
hardly felt the monotony; and, besides, we must remember that the House was filled
with its own ambitions, its envyings, its disappointments, which relieved it of
monotony. Who would not desire to be Abbot and to rank with an Earl?
The Abbot enjoyed that rank: when he rode abroad he was followed by a
retinue of a hundred persons; he could create knights; in some cases he could
coin money; he was guardian to many noble children who became his pages;
he administered a splendid estate. Or one might laudably desire the office of
Prior: he went first after the Abbot; he had his own stall; he put on his
hood before the others. Or there was the sub-Prior: he sat among the monks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
and saw that every one behaved properly; he also, at five o’clock in the evening,
shut up the House.</p>

<p>Then there were administrative offices. These were the Altarer, the Precentor,
the Director of Ceremonies, the Kitchener, the Seneschal, the Bursar, the Sacrist,
the sub-Sacrist, the Almoner, and the Master of the Novices. There were also the
offices of less honour, but which still conferred responsibility and even power; such
as those of the Infirmarer, Porter, Refectorer, Hospitaller, Chamberlain, Keeper of
the Granary, Master of the Common House, Orcharder, Operarius Registrar,
Auditor, Secretary, Butler, Keeper of Baskets, Keeper of the Larder, apart from the
mere service of the House, which required Baker, Brewer, Carpenter, Carver, Sculptor,
Bookbinder, Copyist, etc. As for the morality of the monks, I am inclined to
believe that the Religious Houses maintained much more of their early piety than we
have been accustomed to believe. That they grew luxurious in their living, and in
some cases immoral in their lives, seems to have been due to the cause assigned by
Wyclyf and the Lollards—their great wealth. While they were poor they lived
simple lives; they practised the Rule; they worked at copying Gospels and Mass
Books; some of them kept Chronicles of their own age—an invaluable service;
they received the sick and the poor. In the very worst times that the country ever
experienced, the monasteries stood up here and there over all the land to witness for
justice, and righteousness, and mercy. Bad as these times were, they would have
been far more ferocious and more cruel but for the existence and the example of the
monasteries.</p>

<p>At the same time, there were always scandals. Who could expect in a
monastery that all the younger monks should retain their purity? And when there
was nothing else to think about, who could expect men not to think about their food?
In the time of Henry the Second, Giraldus Cambrensis relates that the monks of
Canterbury had sixteen covers, or more, with an abundance of wine, “particularly
claret, mulberry wine, mead, and other strong drinks.” And it is related by the same
authority that the monks of St. Swithin’s complained to Henry the Second that the
Bishop had reduced their dishes to ten. Upon which the King swore that the
Bishop should reduce the number to what suited himself, namely, three. The
monastic life expected of those who followed it, not a mere obedience to the Rule,
but a total absorption in the spirit of the Rule, so that the Brethren should not look
constantly for possible relaxation and for indulgences, but should desire more and
more all the austerity possible under the Rule. And because there was everywhere
a falling-off from the austerity of the Rule, new branches were continually founded,
and new Orders continually sprang up, in order to return to the ancient Rule with
new austerities. When the Brethren fell to relaxing any portion of the Rule,
the downfall of the House began. Then the spirit went out of the services, the
meaning went out of the offices, the sense went out of the Rules; the Brethren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
became either like Rabelais, weary to death with the daily iteration of services, or
they became careless and sensual, evading and breaking vows as well as the Rule;
or they became dry sticklers for order and jealous for minor customs, though the
essentials had long been lost. This was already the case in the fourteenth century.
Decay was active in most of the Monastic Houses; things were whispered; but still
the bequests poured in upon them from citizens rich and poor; people were loth to
part with the belief in the godly monks. And that there were still saintly hearts in
the cloister, still pious women in the nunnery, even in the worst times of any, there
can be no doubt. But, further, there can be no doubt, also, that there was never
any considerable or notable body of scholars in the English Monasteries from the
time of their foundation to their Dissolution, and that no Monastic Rule ever devised
was calculated to create a love of learning or a school of students, theologians, or
philosophers.</p>

<p>The monasteries possessed a vast amount of property in lands and houses.
The lands were cultivated, and the houses held, in the usual manner. I gather, from
what is said on the subject, that monks made good landlords, just, if exacting. In
their schools they gave free education, but not to all-comers. They also taught
certain trades, but not all; not those of a mere menial kind. Thus they taught
carving, painting, weaving, embroidery, damask work, enamelling, lapidary work,
music, and making musical instruments, illuminations, copying of MSS., medicine,
surgery, the making up of drugs and the composition of cordials. Every Religious
House had within itself a library, a reading-room, a school, a burial-ground, a
cloister, gardens, and walks. Every novice brought some property. Everything, as
I have said, points to the fact that the mediæval monastery in England belonged to
the gentry and not to the lower class.</p>

<p>The monastic life in London was at its best in the twelfth century; later on,
besides the scandals, which perhaps were false or exaggerated, we hear of relaxations,
monks obtaining license for residing outside the House, for “cutting chapel,” for
indulgences in wine and other things.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the Friars. There were five Orders of Friars in London: the
Franciscans, who came to London in 1224; the Dominicans, who settled first in
Oxford, 1221; the Austin Friars, whose London House was founded in 1253; the
Carmelites, or White Friars, in 1341; and the Crutched or Crossed Friars in 1244.
The most numerous and most important of these, the most deeply loved and
reverenced, were the Franciscans, or Grey Friars.</p>

<p>The first appearance of the Franciscans in London was in the year 1224, when
a small company of them appeared and asked for a place wherein to build themselves
a humble lodging. They were granted a place in the least desirable part of the
City, close beside the Shambles, next to “Stinking Lane.” Here they stayed. For
many years after their arrival they worked among the poorer classes of the people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
silently and without attracting much attention. Presently it began to be noised
abroad among the citizens that there was an extraordinary band of Brethren who had
no money and would take none; who had no food except what was given to them;
who went into the poorest and the worst streets, who prayed with the dying
murderer and comforted the dying harlot, and attended the sick robber in a spirit
of divine forgiveness and love. Then the hearts of all went out towards the
Franciscans. Never was any Religious Order so reverenced, never were any religious
men so loved and worshipped by the good people of London. All the world brought
them gifts; they were ruined by the gifts; since they would not receive estates, they
must have gold and jewels; with the gold they built a church, magnificent even in
that age of magnificent churches; since they must remain poor, they spent all their
money on the church and its decorations and furniture.</p>

<p>And then the inevitable decay set in; with so great a Church and so noble a
House the old begging for daily bread became a form; boxes were put up in shops
and houses, and the collectors came round at regular intervals and cleared them;
not a citizen of any substance but left money in his will to the Franciscans; they
received endowments of chantries and obits; they took money for burying great
persons in the Church. The Friars grew careless and self-indulgent; the old zeal
for the poor died away; they were no more seen in the hovels of the poorest. The
Franciscan Rule, in fact, proved too severe to be maintained in all its rigour. Yet
the Dissolution of the Religious Houses shows that in some particulars it was kept
up. For instance, the only property possessed by the Grey Friars when they left
their House was the rent of a few houses built within their precinct. They had no
estates. The great House, with its splendid church, was maintained by the gifts of
nobles and rich merchants; by the endowment, as mentioned above, of chantries; and
by the masses daily bought and said, or sung, “for the intention” of the purchaser.
It is the modern custom in some Catholic countries to buy a mass before undertaking
any enterprise; even before beginning some necessary work, such as
haymaking. This mass is sung “for the intention” of the purchaser. There is,
therefore, reason to believe that the faithful purchased formerly, as they do still,
masses for “good luck.”</p>

<p>The rise, the extent, and the gradual decay in the respect held for Friars is
illustrated very remarkably by the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>. From this valuable book,
which may be accepted as a perfectly trustworthy guide so far as it goes, I have
extracted the following tables of bequests to the five Orders of Friars. These
bequests were sometimes made collectively, so much each to all the Orders of Friars;
sometimes singly, so much to the Austin Friars, or the Preaching Friars. It will
be seen how the fashion of bequeathing money to the Friars grew and increased and
how it died away, as the popular respect for the Friars decreased, and the new
ideas spread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>Up to the year 1311 there are recorded in the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> in all five
such bequests.</p>

<ul><li>Between 1311 and 1324 there are three bequests</li>
<li>Between 1324 and 1332 there are five bequests</li>
<li>Between 1332 and 1339 there are eight bequests</li>
<li>Between 1339 and 1355 there are fifty bequests</li>
<li>Between 1355 and 1400 there are one hundred and thirty-five bequests</li>
<li>Between 1400 and 1412 there are seventeen bequests</li>
<li>Between 1412 and 1436 there are six bequests</li>
<li>Between 1436 and 1530 there are fourteen bequests</li>
</ul>

<p>As for special and separate bequests, the Grey Friars, formerly the most popular
of all, obtained only one bequest between 1396 and 1436; after that, <em>none at all</em>.
The Black Friars got no legacies at all from 1413 to 1503; in the latter year
one fell to them. The White Friars got none between 1395 and 1503, when they
got one. The Austin Friars got none after 1395; the Crutched Friars none
from 1460 to 1518. That is to say, in the bequests, few and small, given during
this period to the various Orders, they get their share, but there is no special gift
made to any.</p>

<p>While considering the subject of wills and bequests, I ran through the volume
edited by Dr. Furnivall called <cite>The Fifty Earliest English Wills</cite>. These were from
1389 to 1439. A brief analysis shows that in most cases bequests are made to the
parish church, either to the High Altar, or to the “Works,” either of vestments, or
of money to the priests and clerks, or of money for masses, a rental of masses or
“the year’s mind” for twenty, seven, or five years. In seventeen cases, or perhaps
more, provision is made for the poor; in three cases for prisons and prisoners; in
three cases for nuns; in one case for an “ankeress”; in one for mending the ways;
in one for repairing a bridge; and in nine cases for friars, either the recognised
Orders, all together, or one or other of them. But four of these cases belong to the
country; there are, therefore, only five belonging to London. The period covers
that when Lollardy was at its highest, and this result confirms the conclusion
arrived at by an analysis of the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>; that, namely, as to the decay
of respect for the Religious.</p>

<p>Then there are those wills published by the Camden Society (<cite>Wills from
Doctors’ Commons</cite>) which belong to the time before the Reformation, viz. those of
Cicely, Duchess of York, 1495; Dame Maude Parr, 1529; Archbishop Warham,
and Charles Brandon.</p>

<p>The Duchess of York leaves bequests to certain colleges named, to the House
of Sion, of which her daughter was prioress, and to certain parishes, but nothing to
the Friars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Dame Maude Parr gives forty shillings each to the four Orders of Friars in
London, and twenty shillings each to the Friars of Northampton.</p>

<p>Archbishop Warham gives nothing to the Friars.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, of bequests to the various Orders, between 1356 and 1412, there are
110, between 1412 and 1544 there are only 7. The contemplation of these figures,
the amazing falling-off of such bequests in the beginning of the fifteenth century,
when Lollardy was rife, the failure of the Friars to recover their old position of
reverence, goes far to show why in London the suppression of the Religious Houses
was effected with so little opposition. The people had ceased to believe in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
holiness of the Friars; as for that of the monks, it was perhaps different, as we shall
see in another place.</p>

<p>Since we have spoken of the decay of belief in the Friars, let us also speak of
the respect actually paid to them when their popularity was at its height.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Black Death, a letter was sent by the Mayor and Aldermen to
the Pope, asking that a certain John de Werthyn, a Dominican Friar, might be
appointed Penitentiarius to the City. The office itself was important. In Confession
there were continually occurring certain cases not provided for in the instructions of
the ordinary priest. In such a case the priest could only grant conditional absolution.
He referred it to his Bishop, who either decided it himself, or, if it was one of an
unusual and difficult kind, passed it on to the Penitentiarius. If he, too, found the
case too grave for his decision, he referred it to the College or Court of Penitentiaries
at Rome, on whose official report the Pope generally acted. The Mayor and
Aldermen, after a preamble to the effect that their City had been of late grievously
afflicted by a dreadful mortality, so that the merchants were not able to wait in
person upon his Holiness, proceeded to petition the Pope that he would “grant
unto the venerable and religious man, Brother John de Werthyn, his chaplain, a man
of honour, of approved life and manners, and also of learning, sprung from the high
blood of the realm, who alone of all others strengthens us with the word of Christ,
that he and he only, within the City may be able to absolve the people being
penitent.” They go on to ask that the office, at his death, may be continued in the
Order of the Dominican Friars.</p>

<p>The satires against the Religious Orders began within the very century of their
foundation in England. One, for example, given in Thomas Wright’s <cite>Political
Poems</cite>, belongs to the reign of Edward the First. It is the poem called “The
Order of Fair Ease.” The Order of Fair Ease takes a point from every Order,
of course it takes the weak point in every case. To begin with, the Order is entirely
confined to gentlefolk—one wonders whether Rabelais had read this satire, and
whether any part of it suggested the Abbey of Thelema.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>As at the Abbey of Sempringham, the Order is to receive both men and women;
but whereas at Sempringham there are walls and ditches to separate the Brethren
from the Sisters, in this Order there is to be no wall or ditch or anything to separate
them. Three times a day, at least, they are to eat, and if they do it in company the
Order will be none the worse.</p>

<p>From Beverley they are to take the custom of eating and drinking well at dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
at supper, and at collation; and after collation every one is to have a piece of candle
as long as from the elbow to the finger ends; and to go on drinking so long as the
candle lasts.</p>

<p>From the Hospitallers they will take their long and sweeping robes.</p>

<p>From the Canons they will take the custom of eating meat three times a week,
and if on Fast Days they find themselves without fish, then they are to eat whatever
is in the larder.</p>

<p>From the Black Monks (the Benedictines) they are to borrow the habit of
getting drunk every day.</p>

</div>

<p>From the Secular Canons, who willingly serve the ladies, the new Order is to
take that point and to be constant companions of the Sisters, both before and after
matins, so that the Order may not on that account fall into discredit.</p>

<p>In the Order of Silence, each brother shuts himself up in his cell; the new
Order shall have the same rule, provided that a sister be locked up with a brother.</p>

<p>In the Friars Minor the Brethren are ordered to take whatever hospitality is
offered them; but they take care never to rest at the house of a poor man, so in the
new Order the Brethren will on no account take up their quarters unless where the
owner is a rich man.</p>

<p>As for the Black Friars—the Preaching Order,—they may wear sandals if they
please and ride if they please. The new Order will always wear sandals and will
always ride.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>
<p>To this we may add Chaucer’s description of a Friar. Now Chaucer was of
London town. This Friar was “a wanton and a merry”; he was a “limitour,” that
is to say, he had his “beat” in which he exercised his craft. “He had made full
many a marriage of young women at his own cost”—that is, whom he had first
seduced. He was greatly respected as a Father confessor, on account of the easy
terms on which he gave absolution, so long as the services gave to the Order:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“For many a man so hard is of his herte,</div>
   <div class="verse">He may not wepe al thogh him sore smerte.</div>
   <div class="verse">Therefore instide of weping and preyeres,</div>
   <div class="verse">Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He carried knives and pins in his tippet, because the Friars had now become pedlars
and carried knives, pins, purses, girdles, silk, etc., to sell in the country places. He
knew all the taverns and every hostler and barmaid (tapster); he was the best
beggar ever known; he could sing and play right well:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“And in his harping whan that he had songe</div>
   <div class="verse">His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,</div>
   <div class="verse">As doon the sterres in the frosty night.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Chaucer’s company contained other functionaries, but for our purpose this is enough.</p>

<p>We need not suppose that the widespread hatred of friars indicated any disbelief
in their doctrines. That would come later, but as yet there seemed no desire for
change in doctrine. The people made songs, and told stories, about the luxury, the
greed, the concupiscence, the license of the friars, but the convents remained, and
the people continued to cling to the supposed sanctity of the place. A man who
one day cursed the whole crew of monks, friars, and pardoners, the next day begged
for a letter of fraternity, by which he might participate in the spiritual advantages of
Carmelite or Augustine; he arranged for burial in the Convent Church; he would
be buried in a friar’s robe; he would found a chantry, a trental, an obit, an
anniversary.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand the roving life of the friar. One supposes that he
was always attached to his Friary. Had he a license to roam and beg? Was he
a limitour, <i>i.e.</i> a friar licensed to hear confessions and grant absolution over a certain
district? Was he a wandering preacher? Were the “simple priests” sent out
by Wyclyf mendicant friars? Did the wandering preachers, whether sent by
Wyclyf or not, all preach the same vague socialism? Some of these questions
may be answered with some degree of certainty. The Friars of the street and
road were nearly all sprung from the lower classes; even the villeins sent their
sons to become Friars and Priests. A very little consideration of the vast army
required for Ecclesiastical purposes, poorly paid, with slender learning, with no
prospects of promotion, will show that the scholars of both Universities must have
amounted to an immense number, consisting chiefly of poor scholars, with a license<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
to beg. The Commons, in the reign of Richard the Second, complained of the
way in which the sons of villeins thus bettered their condition by “advancement
par clergie.” The clerks who issued from the universities obtained episcopal
orders, and in some cases took upon them the vows and robes of the Mendicants.
They then began to wander about the country, preaching and teaching, living on
charity, received into certain houses; and so continued for the rest of their lives.
For the most part, they were careful not to ask for a license from their Bishop;
they had no papers; they were not attached to any House; they roamed about
from village to village, from town to town; in London they preached in the streets,
in the markets, at street corners; they preached not only concerning things religious,
but concerning things social; and belonging themselves to the people, knew what
the people wanted, and preached accordingly.</p>

<p>One of them, John Ball, whose preaching has been thought worthy of the
historian, probably because he was considered to be so mischievous a person, taught
a kind of rough socialism. “At the beginning we were all created equal: it is
the tyranny of perverse men which has caused slavery to arise in spite of God’s
Law: if God had willed that there should be slaves, He would have said at the
beginning of the world who should be slave and who should be lord.” A poor
argument, because, notoriously, we are not created equal, but unequal in every
respect. Also, there is nothing to show that the Creator did not say at the
beginning who should be slave and who should be lord. Froissart also speaks
of John Ball:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This preest vsed often tymes on the sondayes after masse whanne the people were goynge out of
the mynster, to go into the cloyster and preche, and made the people to assemble about hym, and wolde
say thus: A ye good people, the maters gothnot well to passe in Englande, nor shall not do tylle euery
thyng be common, and that there be no villayns not gentylmen.... What haue we deserued or why shulde
we be kept thus in seruage? we be all come from one father and one mother, Adam and Eve: wherby can
they say or shewe that they be gretter lordes than we be, sauynge by that they cause vs to wyn and labour,
for that they dispende ... they dwell in fayre houses, and we haue the payne and trauele, rayne and
wynde in the feldes: and by that that cometh of our labours they kepe and mayteyne their estates....
Lette vs go to the kyng, he is yonge, and shewe hym what seruage we be in.... Thus Johan (Ball) sayd
on sondayes whan the people issued out of the churches with another in the feldes and in the wayes as they
want togyder, affermyng howe Johan Ball sayd trouthe.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That many of the friars held and preached similar doctrines is proved by the
story of Jack Straw, who would have kept no other ecclesiastics upon earth except
the Mendicants. Their popularity, of course, was advanced and preserved by the
social doctrines they preached. But in London they seem to have lost their
popularity very early. In the reign of Edward the Second the Preaching Friars
had to fly before the rage of the people, “on account of their proud behaviour.
And Richard the Second, in 1385, issued a proclamation against certain persons
who, instigated by the Evil Spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> “do openly and secretly stir up our people to
destroy the houses of the said friars, tearing their habits from them, striking them,
and ill-treating them against our peace.”</p>

</div>

<p>The greatest enemies of the mendicant were the parish priest and the monk.
The former found himself abandoned; no one confessed to him; no one listened
to him. They were all running after the mendicant friar, who spoke to them in
their own patois, was one of themselves, who knew their ways and their wants,
and confessed them easily. And Jack Straw’s rebellion showed what had been
the teaching of these wanderers. Since there were so many of them that alms
were not always to be obtained, some, as we have seen, became pedlars:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“They wandren here and there,</div>
   <div class="verse">And dele with divers marcerye,</div>
   <div class="verse">Right as thai pedlers were,</div>
   <div class="verse">That dele with purses, pinnes and knyves,</div>
   <div class="verse">With gyrdles, gloves, for wenches and wyves.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Walsingham, a monk of St. Alban’s, says of them, “The friars, unmindful of their
profession, have even forgotten to what end their Orders were instituted; for the
holy men their law-givers desired them to be poor and free of all kinds of temporal
possessions, that they should not have anything which they might fear to lose
on account of saying the truth. But now they are envious of possessions, approve
the crimes of the great, induce the commonalty into error, and praise the sins of
both: and with the intent of acquiring possessions ... call good evil and evil
good.”</p>

<p>And a popular song of the fourteenth century says of them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Full wisely can they preach and say;</div>
   <div class="verse">But as thei preche no thing do thei,</div>

<li>   Why beg for yourself instead of poor men?</li>
<li>   Why do you not keep the Rule of St. Francis?</li></ul>

<p>In the restoration of the City life of the fourteenth century, remember that
in every street we find the mendicant friar; at dinner-time he walks into any house
he chooses: “Peace be unto this house,” he says, after which, by the Franciscan
rule, it is lawful for him to eat of all meats that are set before him; at the corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of the street there is a wandering preacher denouncing the luxury and sloth of
the rich; his audience is composed of craftsmen in leather jerkins listening with
eager ears and intelligent faces. He is fat and well nourished; he has a full, rich
voice and a certain rude oratory that lays hold of the people and constrains them
to listen. There passes along the street, in a ragged gown, a lean and hungry
chantry priest; he looks at the crowd round the preacher; he hears him talk the
rough, strong East Saxon dialect which has always been the language of the
London craftsman. He sighs, it is his own native patois, but he cannot talk as
this man talks; he is a poor scholar, once a licensed beggar, and now a ragged,
half-starved priest, having nothing but his little chantry endowment. Yet, being
a scholar, he could prove that this man is all wrong. So he sighs and passes on his
way. There comes next a Pardoner with his box hung round his neck; that precious
box in which he has a finger-nail of St. Luke, the feather with which St. Matthew’s
Gospel was written, a piece of a stone thrown at St. Stephen, the last footstep
of the Prophet Elijah embedded in the rock, a piece of St. Peter’s fishing-net—you
can see for yourself that it is a fishing-net, and other very precious relics.
The box also contains pardons and indulgences which this good man sells to the
faithful. At sight of the preacher, however, the Pardoner says nothing. In vain
would he open his box of relics and offer his parchment indulgences in the presence
of this preacher and his listeners. Lollards all! Lollards all!</p>

<p>There rides along the narrow street a monk with hawk on fist bravely dressed.
Behind him walk his men leading the dogs. They are going to cross London
Bridge and gain the wild heath country lying beyond the Southwark and Lambeth
marshes. He regards preacher and crowd alike with scorn ineffable. It is the
hour of Angelus—and from every parish church, from every monastery church,
from every Chapel, from every College, and from the Cathedral, the bells call
the world to silent prayer. For a few moments all are hushed; the roar of London
is stilled; it was not the roar of wheels so much as the sound of ten thousand
hammers. The preacher is silent for a moment; his audience take off their caps;
the monk who goes hawking crosses himself; the Pardoner stands bare-headed:
it is but a moment, then the noise begins again.</p>

<p>The support of the church by the taxes or offerings of the parishioners is a
singular story of conservatism and of gradual development. It was customary
for the congregation on Sundays and Apostles’ days to make offerings or oblations
at the celebration of the mass. This usage became regulated not by law but by
custom, more binding than law, into a payment of one halfpenny by every citizen
who paid a rent of 20s., and one farthing by every citizen who paid a rent of 10s.
The number of days so observed amounted to 60, so that in the former case the
citizen paid 2s. 6d. a year, and in the latter case 1s. 3d. a year. Observe that
this custom amounted to an eighth part of the rent; applied to modern custom, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
an office in the City rented at £100 a year, the citizen would now have to pay
£12:10s.</p>

<p>Bishop Roger Le Noir converted this custom into law in 1228. In 1389
Archbishop Arundel interfered and increased the number of Apostles’ days to
be so observed by 22 more, making the 2s. 6d. into 3s. 9d. An appeal to the
Pope was answered by his support of the Archbishop; but the citizens continued
to grumble. In 1535, probably with the desire of making the Londoners pleased
with his ecclesiastical changes, Henry reduced the 3s. 5d. to 2s. 9d. And so the
tax remained, until the Fire of 1666 necessitated a revision of the law.</p>

<small>CHURCH FURNITURE</small></h3>


<p>The furniture of a London church was elaborate to a degree which astonishes those
accustomed to a simple Anglican ritual. It would also, I believe, astonish the
modern Catholic priest when he thinks of his own village church. The Book of
the <cite>Visitation of Churches belonging to St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1297 and in 1458</cite>
(Camden Society, edited by W. Sparrow Simpson, D.D.) enables us to understand
the extent and the wealth of these churches. The font, of which many specimens
still remain, was generally of stone, but sometimes of marble, and sometimes of
wood. It was kept locked lest the consecrated water should be used for superstitious
purposes. The water was changed every week. The altar was sometimes of stone;
when it was of wood a superaltar of marble or stone or jasper, with feet of silver,
was placed upon it. An altar frontal was generally found, sometimes of carved
wood, sometimes of embroidered work. On the altar were two chalices, one of
silver or silver-gilt, and one of tin; there was a small cross, called <i lang="la">crux parva</i>, to
distinguish it from the rood; there were <i lang="la">phialæ</i> and a <i lang="la">ferrum</i> or stamp for stamping
the altar bread with the letters XPC, IHC, DS. There was a <i lang="la">pix</i> or tabernacle
for the reservation of the Eucharist. This was sometimes a very beautiful casket
of glass, ivory, copper, silver, or enamel, hanging over the altar with canopies.
There was the <i lang="la">crismatorium</i>, with its oil for the sick; there were the carpets before
the altar; the curtains and the veils. There were various kinds of candlesticks and
candelabra of copper, brass, pewter, or even of wood. The expenses of the lights
were defrayed by a kind of rate. A tenant who had a cow paid 12d. a year, one
who had an ewe paid 2d., one who had a wether 1d., and the possessor of a sow 2d.
Of bells there were those hanging in the tower, and the small hand-bells rung at
funerals and at masses. There was a processional cross; there were banners; the
lectern had its hangings; there were chests for the reception of the robes and relics;
there were seats for the clergy, but none for the people, who either stood or knelt on
their own cushions. The <i lang="la">pax</i> or <i lang="la">osculatorium</i> was a tablet of wood, or other material,
which was kissed by the celebrant. At only two of the churches in the Visitation
were there any organs. Then there were the robes and veils; the dalmatic, the
chasuble, the choir cope, the surplice, the canopy held over the newly-married pair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the Lenten veil which covered everything during Lent, etc. Then came the books—the
<i lang="la">Legenda</i>, <i lang="la">Antiphonare</i>, <i lang="la">Gradale</i>, <i lang="la">Psalterium</i>, <i lang="la">Troparium</i>, <i lang="la">Ordinale</i>, <i lang="la">Missale</i>,
<i lang="la">Manuale</i>, <i lang="la">Epistolarium</i>, <i lang="la">Processionale</i>. Many of these books were kept in duplicate:
we can very well understand how the books would be constantly wearing out by
daily use. To replace them in a poor parish was a work of great expense and
trouble. Yet these things were considered necessaries in every church, however
humble. What was to be expected of the great churches endowed and furnished by
princes, nobles, and rich merchants?</p>

<p>Among the minor offices of the Church, that of the blessing of the widow
may be mentioned. The <i lang="la">Benedictio Viduæ</i> accompanied the vow of future chastity.</p>

<p>Between the Gospel and the Epistle the widow knelt before the Bishop sitting
on a fald stool. He asked her in the presence of the congregation if she were
willing to become the spouse of Christ and to give up the lusts of the flesh. She
then read, or caused to be read, the following profession:—“I, A. B., avow to God
perpetual chastity of my body from henceforward, and in the presence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Honourable Father in God, My Lord by the Grace of God, Bishop of C., I promise
steadfastly to live in the Church a widow. Then the Bishop blessed the ring,
sprinkled it with holy water, and put it on the widow’s finger as a sign of her
marriage with Christ, saying:—</p>

<p>“Accipe, Famula Christi, annulum Fidei signum, connubii indicium, quem devota
deferas, casta custodias, quo ad amplexus divini sporsi coronanda perficias. Per
Christum Dominum nostrum. Oremus.”</p>

<p>He then said certain prayers, and the ceremony was completed. Of this
ceremony Furnivall quotes a remarkable instance. In the year 1231 Eleanor, sister
of Henry the Third (and widow of William, Earl of Pembroke, who died 15th
April 1231), took the vow before Edmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard,
Bishop of Chichester. Seven years later, however, she married Simon de Montfort.
The Archbishop protested, and a dispensation was obtained from the Pope.</p>

<p>In 1351 Philippa, widow of Guy, son of Thomas, Earl of Warwick, took the
vow in these words:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>
<p>“En le nom de le Seint Trinitie, Piere, Fils et Seint Esprit jeo Philippa que
fu la feme Sire Guy de Warwyst face puriment et des queor et voluntie entierement,
avow a Dieu et Seint Eglise, et a la benure Virgin Marie et a tout le bel compaigne
delestine et a vous reverent Piere en Dieu Sir Reynaud per le Grace de Dieu
Evesque de Wircester que jeo ameneray ma vie en chastitee defoie en avant, et
chaste ferra de mon corps a tout temps de ma vie.”</p>

<small>THE CALENDAR OF THE YEAR</small></h3>


<p>The influence of the Church on the daily life of London may be illustrated by a
brief Calendar of the Ecclesiastical Year and of the observances of the people.
It is needless to remind ourselves that these observances included an immense
collection of old traditions, ancient pagan customs, and superstitions grafted on
the association of these days with Church history and doctrine. (See Appendix VI.)
The year began with the holy season of Advent, when the Wednesdays and
Fridays were days of that complete Fasting which allowed of one meal only in
the day, and that without meat. On Christmas Eve, and also on St. Agnes’
Eve, girls practised certain divinations to see what husbands they would get.
Thus, they wrote the names of men on onions and laid them by the fire: the
part to sprout or burst was that which contained the name of the coming lover;
and since it was important to know what kind of husband he would be, the maiden
went to the woodstack and pulled out a stick: if it were a straight and even
stick, with no knots, he would be a kind and gentle husband; if it were crooked
or knotty, resignation must be cultivated. At Christmas there were mummings
and feasts and merrymakings; the rooms were decked with holly and all kinds
of green branches; there were pageants, masques, and moralities. In the church
was acted the Nativity, with the angels and the shepherds and the Child in the
cradle; in some places children danced before the altar. On the day of St.
Stephen horses were made to gallop about, and were bled to keep them well
throughout the year. On the day of St. John the people bought of the priests
manchets made with hallowed wine as a preventive against storms. At
Childermasse—28th December,—Innocents’ Day, they whipped the children
so that they might remember the slaughter of the Innocents. Then came
the New Year:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Then giftes the husband gives his wife and father eke the child</div>
   <div class="verse">And master on his men bestows the like with favor milde:</div>
   <div class="verse">And good beginning of the year they wish and wish again,</div>
   <div class="verse">According to the ancient guise of heathen people vaine:</div>
   <div class="verse">Then eight days no man doth require his dettes of any man</div>
   <div class="verse">Their tables do they furnish out with all the meat they can.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>
<p>The month of January was a time of great revelry, simply because the short day
brought work to a close between four and five, and left a long evening.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“In January men do play</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">In cards and dice their time away;</div>
   <div class="verse">Now men and maids do merry make</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">At stoolball and at barley break.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On Twelfth Day they chose a king by lottery of the Cake: the king was lifted
up on the hands of the others while he traced the sign of the Cross upon every
rafter in the roof. This blessed sign kept off Devils. Another singular custom
on this day was that the master of the house at eventide set down a loaf of bread
on the hearth, and strewed frankincense on a pan of coals. He then, followed
by the whole of his household, inhaled the fumes. This was to keep them all
during the year to come from toothache, earache, or any malady of the eyes and
nose. When all had thus fortified themselves, they took up the loaf and the pan
of coals and bore them round the house. In so simple a way were they enabled
to insure themselves against want of food and the power of witches. On Candlemas
Day, 2nd February, every one offered a taper. These tapers were sovereign
for keeping off ghosts, lightning, storm, and tempest. On the day of St. Blasius,
they procured, at great cost, water made holy by being passed through one of the
Saint’s bones. Barrels of this water were sold. Valentine’s Day they observed
with zeal; says John Lydgate:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Seynte Valentyn, of custom yeere by yeere</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Men have an usance in this regioun,</div>
   <div class="verse">To loke and serche Cupid’s Kalendere,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">And chose theyr choyse by grete affectioun:</div>
   <div class="verse">Such as ben prike with Cupid’s nocioun,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Takyng theyr choyse as theyre sort doth falle:</div>
   <div class="verse">But I love oone which excellith alle.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shrove Tuesday brought a very madness of revelry: the people dressed up like
wild beasts and ran about the streets; they danced; they made shows; they
feasted and drank. The street processions did not end with Shrove Tuesday,
they were carried over to Ash Wednesday, when every one paraded the streets
carrying a herring on a pole and singing doggerel. And the approach of spring
was celebrated by the following rough sport, evidently an ancient custom:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“In some place all the youthful flocke with minstrels doe repaire,</div>
   <div class="verse">And out of every house they pluck the girles and maidens faire;</div>
   <div class="verse">And them to plough they straitway put, with whip one doth them hit:</div>
   <div class="verse">Another holds the plough in hand: the Minstrel here doth sit</div>
   <div class="verse">Amid the same and drunken songs with gaping mouth he sings</div>
   <div class="verse">Whom foloweth one that sows out sande, or ashes fondly flings.</div>
   <div class="verse">When thus they through the streets have plaied, the man that gardeth all</div>
   <div class="verse">Doth drive both plough and maidens through some pond or river small:</div>
   <div class="verse">And dabbled all with dirt, and wringing wet as they may bee</div>
   <div class="verse">To supper calls and after that to dancing lustilee.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>
<p>Then fell upon the City a time of great sadness. In the churches the images
were covered up with painted cloths, on which was declared, one knows not
how, the “Wrath and furie great of God”; the butchers’ stalls were closed;
the shambles were innocent of blood; the cooks’ shops furnished nothing but
fish; and devout people, and men and women of religion, took but one meal in
the day. On Palm Sunday there was the Procession of the Entry into Jerusalem;
after the Procession and Mass the boys led the Ass about the parish begging for
money and eggs.</p>

<p>For three days before Easter in this City of multitudinous bells—bells of
monasteries, bells of colleges, bells of hospitals, bells of churches—there was a
stillness profound. No bells were rung at all. The sexton climbed the tower
or the steeple and called to mass with a wooden clapper. The boys ran about
the streets with wooden clappers calling the people to church. It is even said
that during the solemn darkness of the Tenebrose, the ’prentices carried on a
free fight. And during this week the curious custom was observed of bringing
into every great man’s house a twisted tree. At Easter Eve all fires were put
out and renewed from flint and steel. The water for baptism was hallowed with
a procession of crosses, tapers, and banners. It was lucky to carry some banner.
On Easter Day the Resurrection was represented in many churches. On this
day, also, people ate radishes to keep off agues. On one of the three days before
the Ascension the parish bounds were beaten by the parish beadles and a pack
of boys. On Ascension Day it was the custom to eat birds, for their upward
flight was held to be a symbol of the Ascension. At church the image of our
Lord was literally pulled up to the roof with ropes, while an image of Satan was
thrown down and broken to pieces.</p>

<p>On Whit Sunday white pigeons and doves were set free in the church. On
Corpus Christi Day, the Host was carried about in a procession followed by
representations of the Saints.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Fayre Ursley with her maidens all, doth passe amid the wayes:</div>
   <div class="verse">And valiant George with speare that killed the dreadful dragon here:</div>
   <div class="verse">The Devil’s house is drawn about where in there doth appere</div>

   <div class="verse">A number great of salving belles with pleasant sound doe ring.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the Feast of John the Baptist bonfires were lighted and the young people
danced in the street, a survival of the midsummer rejoicings. Every house on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
this evening was decorated with leaves and branches, green birch, fennel, white
lilies, St. John’s wort and garlands, with variegated lamps, which were hung up
everywhere. There were miracle plays enacted in the summer on carts and
wheeled machines. At Martinmas, 11th November, the beginning of winter,
roast goose was eaten, and boys went about singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“It is the Day of Martilmass</div>

   <div class="verse">Never heeding winter’s face</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">On the day of Martilmass.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The religious functions of the Lord Mayor and Corporation were many, and
were considered inseparable from the office. I have elsewhere called attention
to the point that it is futile to ask whether any mediæval Foundation, Corporation,
or Institution was religious in character, because at that time nothing could
be considered which was not based upon, or supported by, religion.</p>

<p>The following are some of the religious duties imposed upon the Mayor.
On the morrow of SS. Simon and Jude the Mayor, newly elected, took the oaths
at the Exchequer in the morning. He then dined, and after dinner he proceeded
to the Church of St. Thomas of Acon, where prayers were said. Thence he went
in procession to St. Paul’s, where, kneeling in the nave, he prayed for the soul
of Bishop William, who saved the liberties of the City at the Norman Conquest.
After this he went out into the churchyard, where he prayed for the souls of the
Martyr’s parents buried there. This done, he returned to the Church of St. Thomas
of Acon, where he and the Aldermen made an offering. This conclusion of the
afternoon’s ceremonies was conducted, if it was already dark, by torchlight.</p>

<p>On the Day of All Saints the Mayor with his household, the Aldermen with
their households, and the substantial citizens, all marched together to St. Paul’s
and heard vespers.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day they again went to St. Paul’s to hear vespers and compline,
the Mayor sitting on the right hand of the Dean.</p>

<p>On Whit Monday the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs met in the Church of
St. Peter, Cornhill: they were met by the clergy of the City churches, and, a
procession being formed in which the clergy led the way, they walked through
Chepe to St. Paul’s. Entering by the north side they were met by the officials
of the Cathedral, and escorted through the transepts to the south side, where
they went out, and walking through “the Close of Watling Street,” <i>i.e.</i> the
south part of St. Paul’s Precinct, they entered at the great door of the west. In
the nave they heard the hymn, “Veni Creator,” while a winged angel in white
robes censed the people from the roof. This done, the Mayor advanced to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Altar and laid his offering upon it. It will be observed that he represented the
City, and prayed for the guidance of the Holy Spirit not for himself but for the
whole City.</p>

<p>On Whit Tuesday the same ceremony was observed. But the procession
was formed at the Church of St. Michael le Querne, outside the Precinct of Paul’s,
and was joined by the common folk of Middlesex. The same ceremony was
performed in the Cathedral. On Whit Wednesday the same ceremony was
performed for the third time, but with the common folk of Essex. The Mayor
on these two days represented, therefore, the people of two counties.</p>

</div>

<p>There were many other occasions in the year when the Mayor went in state
to certain City churches.</p>

<p>On occasions of rejoicings there were also special visits. Thus, on the news
of the birth of Edward the Third the Mayor and Aldermen repaired immediately
to the Cathedral, where the Bishop sang mass, and after mass, to the sound of
trumpets, the Mayor and Aldermen “led the Carol” (“menerent la Karole”).
A few days after a great pageant was celebrated in the City.</p>

<p>Mention is made above of one or two charms against certain diseases. It
must not be forgotten that for every disease there was a saint who could ward
it off. It was part of the wise woman’s lore to know all these saints and to invoke
their aid when she applied her herbs. Here is a list:—St. Appolus preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
the teeth, St. Otilia the eyes, St. Vitus the brain, St. Laurence the back and
shoulders, St. Valentine prevented the falling sickness, St. Erasmus saved from
colic, St. Blasius from quinsy, St. Peruel from ague, St. John from prison (a
very dreadful disease), St. Mark from sudden death, St. Suran from infamy, St.
Wolfgang from gout, St. Agatha from fire, St. Christopher from ghosts, St. Anne
from wealth—why was not she the patron saint of this merchant city? St. Wendlin
kept the cattle, St. Antony the hogs, St. Gertrude drove off mice and rats, St.
Magnus grasshoppers, St. Nicolas protected mariners, St. Indocus the crops,
St. George looked after the horsemen, St. Luke the painters, St. Cosmus the
physicians, St. Leonard the prisoners, St. Botolph the travellers, while all these
functions and many others were ascribed to the Virgin Mary, in whom was centred
all the love and faith and veneration and hope possible among millions of ignorant
women governed by their affections and passions.</p>

<p>They were great believers in charms in those days: in the peril of child-birth
the women purified the chamber to keep off evil spirits; the men went to sea, on a
journey, to battle, with charms hung round their necks to keep them safe. These
charms were sometimes a verse of the Gospel enclosed in a silver box hung about
the neck with a silver chain: or words meaning nothing, or crosses drawn with
blood or painted; the men had their swords charmed or blessed; they had their
horses charmed. Again, the people were great believers in astrology, necromancy,
and the influence of the moon. Before undertaking anything the position of the
moon was first consulted. Unless this was favourable they would not only abstain
from beginning any enterprise of importance, but they would not bathe, or cut
their hair, or pare their nails, or even take medicine. Some of these superstitions
we know still linger, but they exercise no real influence. Lucky and unlucky
days are all forgotten: omens are very feeble things, we have practically outgrown
them. But we must realise that in the London of the fourteenth century the
whole population were under the governance of superstitions; I am not speaking
of their religion, but of the superstitious beliefs that are outside religious dogma
and religious observance. The time seems to those who look into it full of activity,
full of joyousness, full of brightness. All these things, undoubtedly, do belong to
Plantagenet London. Wealth, good work, good wages, splendid dress, good food,
good wine, good ale, and outdoor life—yet, withal, an ever-present dread of the
unknown, of the immediate future, of what chance, luck, fate or the anger of a
saint might bring. It was, in a word, the life which seizes with avidity on the
present, and enjoys what the gods provide from day to day.</p>

<small>HERMITS AND ANCHORITES</small></h3>


<p>There is one branch of ecclesiastical history which has been curiously neglected, that,
namely, concerned with the anchorite, ankret, anchoress, or ankress. That is to say,
it is generally concluded that a hermit and an anchorite are the same persons. One
might as well think that a monk is the same as a friar.</p>

<p>There was nothing to prevent a hermit setting up his cell wherever he pleased;
yet there were certain places where a hermitage was a recognised institution, and
the hermit was, so to speak, presented as to a living. Thus, there was a hermitage
outside the City wall at Aldgate, one at Bishopsgate, one at Cripplegate, one at
Charing Cross, one at St. Laurence Jewry; a hermitage was often found at a bridge,
and by the roadside, in a forest, or in any place not too secluded, because a hermit
lived upon alms, and had therefore of necessity to reside near the haunts of men.
The character and reputation of the hermitage depended entirely upon the character
of the occupant, and therefore varied from time to time. William of Langland
speaks of “fals hermits,”—“But these hermits who build their dwelling by the highway,
of yore were workmen, weavers and tailors, and carters’ knaves, and graceless
clerks. They kept full hungry house and had much want, long labour and little
earning, and at last espied that liars in friars’ clothing had fat cheeks. Therefore
these unlearned knaves left their labour and clothed themselves in cloaks like clerks,
or as if they were of some Order, or else prophets.”</p>

<p>Hermitages were not occupied continuously; if one hermit died, his cell was
vacated, and not necessarily filled up. A few of these hermitages remain, as, for
example, that of Warkworth, which is a very striking monument. On the other
hand, an anchorite was a recluse; he was shut up and separated from the world; he
never came out of his cell. Before a man or woman was allowed to become an
anchorite he had to obtain a license from the Bishop, who also required of the
Rector or Vicar of his church, of the Abbot or Prior of the House, that the
anchorite should be properly supplied with food. The hermit was free to roam—<i lang="la">solivagus</i>;
the anchorite was shut up—<i lang="la">conclusus</i>. The difference between the
hermit and the anchorite is drawn clearly by R. Sharpe (<cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>, ii. 33).</p>

<p>“An Anchorite’s cell—or ankerhold, as it was sometimes called—was usually in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
or near a church, although not always: it was so situate that the recluse might see
the altar and hear the service, and its door was locked and often walled up, one or
more iron-barred windows being left open by which he could receive the Communion
and the necessaries of life. He was often a priest and much resorted to as a confessor,
as, indeed, were also some hermits. The latter, however, commonly followed
a trade or occupation.</p>

<p>Although anchorites were not hermits, ankerholds were sometimes called
hermitages, and the distinction between the two classes of religious is not always
preserved in the Husting wills. Thus we have in one will a reference made to the
tenement of the hermit of Cripplegate—a hermitage founded by Mary de St. Pol,
Countess of Pembroke, for the soul of her unfortunate husband Aylmer de Valence—and
in another a bequest made to the anchorite at Cripplegate, as well as to the
anchorite at Holborn. That both classes were held in high esteem by the citizens
of London is shown by the numerous bequests made to every anchorite and every
hermit in or near London. Besides the anchorites or hermits at Cripplegate and
Holborn, we have special mention made of the hermit in the meadows beyond the
Thames, the hermit near Charing Cross, and the hermit near Bishopsgate: the
anchorite living in the Church of St. Peter, Cornhill; Friar John Ingram, the
anchorite near the hospital of St. Katharine in the neighbourhood of the Tower,
previously described in the will of Geoffrey Patrik (1371) as the hermit
living at a place called ‘le Swannesnest’ near the Tower; and, in the same
will, Friar Richard de Swepeston, the hermit near the Church of St. Laurence
in the Jewry, and Geoffrey his companion. The mention of a companion for a
hermit seems incongruous, but it appears from a rule for solitaries drawn up by
Grimlaic, an anchorite priest in the ninth century, or perhaps somewhat later, that
several were permitted to dwell together in one enclosure and have communication
by a window, provided the cell of every one was separate.”</p>

<p>Of ankresses there were many. Such was Juliana of Norwich, whose book of
Ejaculations has been preserved: such was the anchoress of Bishopsgate, who
received 40s. a year from the Sheriffs of London. Such was Christina of St.
Alban’s: such were the anchoresses of St. Giles, St. Benedict, and St. Mary de
Manny.</p>

<p>The frequent mention in the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> of the anchorites in and around
London shows that there were always many of these <i lang="la">inclusi</i>, and that they were
held in great respect; but since men, evidently not wealthy, left money to all, it is
certain that there were not anchorites and ankresses attached to every church. So
few of the old London churches are left that it is impossible to look to them for
much information on this point. It is said that traces of the anchorite’s cell may
still be seen in the Inner Cloisters of Westminster Abbey, but for my own part I
have failed to distinguish them. They should be part of the ruins of St. Catherin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>e’s
Chapel. If, however, we turn to the village churches about the country, we find
indications which point to the anchorite’s cell as well as to other things.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not uncommon to find in the chancel of many churches built before
the fifteenth century low side windows, sometimes with shutters, sometimes without.
These are commonly called lepers’ windows, and one is told how the lepers, forbidden
to enter the church, were allowed to assist in the mass by looking through
the window at the altar. The Cambridge Camden Society called them lychnoscopes.</p>

<p>As regards the theory of the lepers, we must remember the rigid laws concerning
the separation of leprous persons: they were not allowed to enter inns, churches,
mills, or bakehouses; they were not to touch healthy persons; they were not to eat
with healthy persons; they were not to wash in streams; they were not to walk in
narrow footpaths; they wore a distinctive dress, and they carried a clapper to give
warning of their approach. There were also lazar-houses for their residence, no
less than ninety-five of the first class in England, besides smaller ones. With these
regulations, what room was there for an isolated leper in a village? Where would
he live? How would he live? Where there were small lazar-houses the lepers’
window is conceivable, but not in the little village where the leper could not be
allowed to live at all. So that for most of these villages we may discard the theory
of the lepers’ squint altogether.</p>

<p>A valuable paper on the low side windows of certain Surrey churches may be
found in the <cite>Transactions of the Surrey Archæological Society</cite> (vol. xiv. part ii.), in
which the writer gives drawings of many of these windows with detailed descriptions,
and shows that they served one of two purposes—either for the confessional, in
which case the priest sat within the church and the penitent knelt without; he
proves that the practice was common in these churches where the only other place
of confession was “behind the veil,” <i>i.e.</i> in the chancel. The other purpose was
for the anchorite to take part in the service through this window. There are
indications in some of the churches that a cell formerly existed against the church
wall, <i>e.g.</i> the marks of a peat-roof in the wall. In one church, that of Hurtly, near
Rainham, the cell itself remains to this day.</p>

<p>The writer observes that these low side windows are not found in churches built
during the second half of the fifteenth century. He attributes this to the decay into
which the friars, who had formerly been the favourite confessors, had fallen. In
another place, I have shown that the practice of making bequests to the friars,
hermits, and anchorites of London gradually decayed and finally ceased during the
same period. May we not believe that the decay of the respect formerly paid to the
religious of all kinds affected the demand for anchorites and therefore the supply?
It is surely reasonable to believe that when the calling or profession of an <i lang="la">inclusus</i>
was no longer attended by the general belief in superior sanctity, one attraction,
perhaps the principal one, towards the life would no longer exist, while it is certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
that the knowledge and the proof of such a belief would be a powerful support and
a certain encouragement to the anchorite in enduring the lonely vigils, the frosts
and cold, the silence of the night, the visits and the mockeries and the terror of the
Fiend, and all the miseries of the cell, which he was never to leave until death called
him forth.</p>

<p>In my book on “Westminster” I have described the consecration of a recluse—supposing,
without any historical foundation, that the Sub-prior was ready to take
the place of the late anchorite. The manner of the consecration is supposed to be
described by one of the monks:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>
<p>“The Sub-prior, being a priest, was taken into the choir, where he prostrated
himself with bare feet. The Abbot and three of the brethren who were priests
having taken their places, the Cantor began the service with the responsory, <i lang="la">Beati
in melius</i>, after which the Abbot and assistants before the altar sang with the choir
certain Psalms fourteen in number. After the Psalms followed a Litany, the choir
singing after each clause, <i lang="la">Ora pro eo</i>. The Litany finished, the Abbot advanced
towards the prostrate brother bearing a crucifix, a thurible, and holy water, and,
standing over him, he thrice sprinkled him with water, censed him, and prayed over
him. The Abbot then raised the candidate with his own hands, and gave him two
lighted tapers, at the same time admonishing him to remain steadfast in the love of
God. Then the candidate, standing, listened to the Deacon, who read first from
the prophet Isaiah, next the Gospel according to Saint Luke, as on the Festival of
the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. After this the new garments which he was to
put on were blessed. The candidate then took the vows, which were three only,
and those the same as the vows at profession, viz. of chastity, of obedience, and of
steadfastness.</p>

<p>The candidate next kneeled at the altar, and, kissing it three times, repeated
each time the words <i lang="la">Suscipe me, Domine</i>, etc., the choir responding. This done
he offered the two tapers at the altar, and again kneeled while the Abbot removed
his monastic frock and clothed him with the garments newly blessed. Then
followed a service of prayer. It was the <i lang="la">Veni Creator</i>, with the <i lang="la">Paternoster</i> and <i lang="la">Et
ne nos</i>. The Abbot then, standing on the north side of the altar, preached to the
brethren and to the congregation assembled, commending the new recluse to their
prayers. The candidate then himself sang the mass of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>We had now completed that part of the consecration which takes place in the
church. The Abbot then took the new recluse by the hand and led him down the
nave of the church, followed by the choir and all the brethren, unto the little door
leading into the West Cloister. The church was filled with people to see the sight.
A new recluse is not seen every day. There were the <i lang="la">domicellae</i>, the maidens of
the Queen, come from the Palace; there were knights and pages, and even men-at-arms;
there were sanctuary men, women, and children; men with hawks upon their
wrists; men with dogs; merchants from the wool staple; girls of wanton looks
from the streets and taverns beyond the walls. The hawks jangled their bells, the
dogs barked, the women chattered, the men talked loudly, the girls looked at the
brothers as they passed, and whispered and laughed: and I heard one brother say
to another that this was a thing which would make the Sub-prior return to the
monastery an he saw it. And all alike craned their necks to see the man who was
going to be shut up in a narrow cell for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>The ankret’s cell is on the south side of the Infirmary Cloister. It is built of
stone, being twelve feet long, eight feet broad, and with an arched roof about ten
feet high. On the side of the church there is a narrow opening by which the
occupant can hear mass and can see the elevation in the Chapel of St. Catherine.
On the other side is a grating by which he can receive his food and converse with
the world. But it is too high up for him to see out of it; therefore he has nothing
to look upon but the walls of his cell. This morning the west side had been broken
down in order to remove the body of the dead man and to cleanse the cell for the
new-comer. So, while we gathered round in a circle, and the people stood behind
us, the Abbot entered the cell, and censed it, and sprinkled it with holy water,
singing more Psalms and more prayers. When he came forth the recluse himself
entered, saying aloud: <i lang="la">Hæc requies mea in seculum seculi</i>. The choir sang another
Psalm. Then the Abbot sprinkled dust upon the head of the recluse with the
words beginning <i lang="la">De terra plasmasti</i>.</p>

<p>This done, the <i lang="la">Operarius cum suis operariis</i> replaced the stones and built up
the wall anew. And then, singing another Psalm, we went back to the cloister,
leaving the Sub-prior to begin his lifelong imprisonment. A stone bench for bed,
his frock for blanket, a crucifix, and no other furniture. In the cold nights that
followed, lying in my bed in the dormitory, I often bethought myself of the former
Sub-prior alone in his dark cell, with Devils whispering temptation through the
grating (Devils always assail every new recluse), well-nigh frozen, praying with
trembling lips and chattering teeth. No, I am not worthy. Such things are
too high for me.”</p>

<p>It seems as if, for a period of some hundred years, every monastic house and
many churches possessed a recluse, man or woman. They were specially bound to
pray for the House or the Church, probably for the parish as well. They
frequently arrived at a reputation of the highest sanctity; they were consulted as an
oracle. Thus Richard the Second, before he started on his dangerous journey to
put down the rebellion, consulted the anchorite of Westminster. So also Henry the
Fifth spent the night after his father’s funeral in weeping, prayer, and confession
with the anchorite’s successor.</p>

<p>The anchorite’s cell was not always of the same shape or form. Sometimes it
was partly or wholly underground; sometimes a grated window communicated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the outside and enabled the occupier to see and to be seen; sometimes the grated
window was too high for the anchorite to see his visitors or to be seen by them. In
the nunnery of Marmoustin at Tours there was an anchorite’s cell in which the
occupant was totally secluded; at Royston there was a subterranean cell to which
there was an approach from the outside and an opening on the top. The approach
was probably blocked up when the recluse entered the cell and all communications
were through the upper opening. At Bengeo, Herts. (see Appendix VII.), the
anchorite’s cell consisted of a wooden hut placed against the north-east end of the
chancel. It was eight feet long and six feet high; there was a recess in the wall
for the anchorite’s bed and seat; there was an entrance into the church; perhaps
the anchorite was a chantry priest.</p>

<div class="caption">ALL HALLOWS, LONDON WALL</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes there were two ankresses living in the churchyard, but not in the
same cell. Henry the Fourth before his accession to the throne endowed an
anchorite’s cell in a village of Lancashire. The ankress very often took care of the
church and kept it clean. As regards London, the bequests to anchorites are
numerous. We read of ankresses at St. Michael’s and St. Giles, Cornhill; at
St. Giles, St. Benedict, and St. Mary Manny, we read of a lady getting so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
square feet of ground for the purpose of building an anchorite’s cell; we read of
anchorites at St. Albans, St. Giles, and Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>One of the earliest Old English works is the <i>Ancren Reiwle</i> or Rule for
Anchorites. It was written for three ladies who had resolved upon adopting the
recluse life in a village in Dorsetshire. The author is doubtful. It was perhaps
Richard Poor, Bishop successively of Chichester, Salisbury, and Durham, in which
case it is older than 1237, the year of Richard Poor’s death; or else by Simon of
Ghent, a native of London, Archdeacon of Oxford, 1284, Bishop of Salisbury, 1297.
He died in 1315. The dates are of importance, because the recluse life would not
seem to have become common before the middle of the thirteenth century, and it
would further seem to have fallen into disuse by the end of the fourteenth century.
The work itself seems to show that these ladies were adopting a new thing, or at
least an unusual thing.</p>

<p>During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, however, we must remember
that in every Monastic House, and in most churches, the cell of the anchorite was
built against the chancel wall with an opening to allow the occupant to “see God,”
<i>i.e.</i> to witness the elevation of the mass every day; that at all hours of the day and
night were to be heard the prayers, the praises, the ejaculations, the groans of the
man or woman thus buried alive.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand the attraction of such a life. Probably the very
horror of it attracted some minds. To be alone day and night so long as life should
last, to pray continually, never to enjoy one single comfort or solace or relief from
physical pain, to be always cold, always hungry, always clad in rags, always unkempt
and unwashed, to have to battle every night with superstitious terrors and the
invention of an excited imagination, to dwell perpetually on images of death, these
things make the life so terrible that the mere merit of choosing it appeared
extraordinary; the Gates of Heaven would surely be thrown open to one who
had passed years of such endurance and such combat.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself such an anchorite. He rises slowly from his knees; his
limbs are full of rheumatic pains; he straightens himself with difficulty; he advances
to the grating and looks through the bars. He is a gaunt tall man, as thin as living
man can be; he is clad in rags; his hair flows over his shoulders; his beard falls
down to his waist; his cheeks are hollow; his shrunken eyes are like coals of fire.
He prays for the Church and all the souls of those who belong to the Church, that
is to say, the dead as well as the living. Great are the blessings conferred on a
parish by the prayers of an anchorite! He prays all day and all night; while others
sleep the anchorite is offering continual supplication. He is racked with pains; he is
always cold, always hungry, always unwashed; yet he is not unhappy. He is
supported by Faith undoubting; and he has consolations and compensations. The
Virgin Mary sends him angels who sing carols for him alone to hear; they are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
foretaste of the singing in Heaven; he is allowed even to see the gates of Heaven
standing open and the blessed saints sitting on their thrones exactly like the barons
at a coronation. And he is visited by devils who are always beaten back and are
always returning with fresh whispers and fresh temptations. Sweet are the joys of
battle! He wrestles nightly with the Fiend, and every night sends him out of the
barred window screeching with rage and disappointment. Oh, the anchorite is a
happy man! And sometimes he is blessed with the gift of prophecy: he knows
what is coming: in the morning he remembers his vision, and perhaps the very
words are taken down and preserved. He is also, if he chooses, the parish oracle:
he is asked to advise on all subjects, for there is no subject into which religion
cannot enter. Merchants consult him about their ventures; women about their
love affairs; princes about their policy. See, there is a girl tripping over the long
grass: she bears a basket; it contains a gift of food for the anchorite, such simple
food as he will receive; and she comes with heightened colour because she is going
to ask a question of a most delicate nature concerning a young man. In some
churchyards, where the anchorite is good-humoured and popular, or where there is
an ankress, the grating of a cell has been known to become a place of resort; it is
said that scandals and mischievous gossip were sometimes first started outside the
ankress’ cell; all the women went there to talk of what was going on in the
parish; the cell became a nuisance; the parish priest spoke about it; the Bishop
heard of it.</p>

<p>Think of the effect upon the imagination produced outside by the mere voice of
the unseen solitary who, as long as he lived, would never change his clothes, nor
wash himself, nor cut his hair or beard, nor look upon the face of other men, nor see
the sunshine and the blue sky, nor look for any physical comfort or solace so long
as life should endure. They knew he was there; they came and spoke to him; the
hollow voice came out of the grave in reply; they lowered food; one day they came
and heard no voice in reply; they removed the stones and looked in. God had
summoned the man of long endurance; who would take his place?</p>

<p>I said, above, that for a hundred years there were anchorites attached to most
churches. My reason for assigning this period is that the London citizens began to
bequeath property to anchorites in the middle of the fourteenth century, in the
year 1341, and left off the practice at the same time as they left off bequeathing
property to the Friars about the year 1400. For sixty years there was a general
formula with all those who had property to leave. They bequeathed small sums to
their own parish church, to all the five orders of friars, to every anchorite in London,
or to every anchorite, man or woman, in and about the City of London, to every
hermit in London, to every leper in London, to every poor prisoner in London.
The reason why the fashion of giving bequests to the maintenance of solitaries began
so late and ended so quickly was, I suppose, that the practice of building anchorites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>’
cells became more common in the fourteenth century than it had been in former
times; that men clutched at every chance of getting prayers as well as masses for
their souls; that the appearance of so many newly built cells struck their imagination;
that they thought the prayers of a holy anchorite must be of great efficacy
inasmuch as the man not only led a saintly life but endured continual sufferings.
In the same way they left money to lepers and to prisoners in order to obtain
their prayers.</p>

<p>And the reason why the fashion of bequeathing money to anchorites suddenly
ceased was that by the end of the fourteenth century the mind of London was
saturated with that part of Lollardy which scoffed at hermits, friars, and monks. At
the time when the House of Commons was petitioning the King to suppress all
Religious Houses of every kind, the rich men of the City left off, as if by common
consent, as if by a kind of conspiracy or secret resolution, the bequeathing of money to
friars, hermits, and anchorites. A broad black line is drawn. No more money shall
be left to these people. It would be interesting, if it were possible, to learn what
became of the anchorites and the hermits. Some of them, no doubt, survived till
the Reformation. Can we imagine, with the Dissolution of the Monastery, the
suppression of the Anchorite? Can we imagine the old man, with his grey hair,
his beard flowing to his waist, scarcely clad decently in the rags which he has
worn for fifty years, with sunken cheeks and haggard face and wild eyes blinking
at the light, and wondering why after so many years he is dragged out once more
into the sunshine and the sight of his fellow-men?</p>

<small>PILGRIMAGE</small></h3>


<p>Pilgrimage, never so great a craze in London as in the country, or in England as
in France, plays an important part in the mediæval life. The earliest pilgrimage
was, of course, to the Holy Places of Jerusalem: it began in the second century
with a journey to the site of the Ascension. The other sites multiplied with the
increase of pilgrims and the demand for sites and sacred relics and associations.
The desire to go pilgrimaging grew and spread with great rapidity among all
classes. In the century before the Crusades the roads to Palestine were black with
swarms of pilgrims: we have the history of many early pilgrimages, including that
written down by the Abbot Adamnanus of Scotland from the lips of the shipwrecked
pilgrim Arnulfus, and that of Willibald the English pilgrim who started
with his father and sister Walfunga, his brother Wunibald, and a large party of
followers and servants: in Italy the father died and the brother and sister went
home: Willibald persevered and reached Jerusalem safely.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand why the pilgrimage attracted so many. It was full of
adventure and of danger. On the other hand, it was greatly meritorious: if one
was killed on a pilgrimage, the doors of heaven were thrown open: if one returned
in safety the term of purgatory was shortened. Then the pilgrim got away from
his work: he had nothing to do but to plod on: he wanted no money: every day
brought him to some hospitable monastery where he found supper, bed, and
breakfast: he made new acquaintances and new friends perpetually: the way was
enlivened by talk, and by casual potations: in the evening there was sometimes
revelry at an inn, with wine or ale and music and dancing and the shows of the
<i lang="fr">jogleurs</i>. Who would not exchange the dull and tedious life in the country for a
time of such varied experience and entertainment?</p>

<p>The practice quickly became an abuse. The peasant deserted his plough, his
wife, and his children, to go pilgrimaging. The craftsman left his bench and his shop,
in search of adventures as a pilgrim: even the monk left his monastery to wander
out into the world, sometimes never to come back again: sometimes he did come
back, with the confession of broken vows. The Church, therefore, interfered. No
one must go on pilgrimage without the Bishop’s license. This granted, the pilgrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
was solemnly invested with the scrip and staff, and the long woollen robe which
formed the chief part of his dress. The parish priest with his friends accompanied
him to the boundaries of his parish and he set forth, armed with the Bishop’s
license and a passport which procured him hospitality in all Christian countries.</p>

<p>“In the name of God,” ran the commendatory letter, “we would have your
highness or holiness to know that the bearer of the present letters, our brother,
has asked our permission to go peaceably on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, either for his
own sins, or to pray for our preservation. Thereupon, we have given him these
present letters, in which we salute you, and pray you, for the love of God and Saint
Peter, to receive him as your guest, to be useful to him in going and coming back,
so that he may return in safety to his house: and as is your good custom, make
him pass happy days. May God the Eternal King protect you, and keep you in
His kingdom!”</p>

<p>The Church did more than bless the pilgrim: it celebrated in one of those
dramas by which so much was taught, the act of pilgrimage itself, in a service which
has been preserved. The following is an abridgment:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>
<p>“In the nave of the church was erected a fort, ‘castellum,’ representing the
house at Emmaus where the two travellers entered and broke bread with Christ.
At the appointed time two priests, ‘of the second seats,’ appointed for the day,
came forth from the vestry singing the hymn which begins ‘Jesu, nostra
redemptio.’ They were to be dressed in tunics, ‘et desuper cappis transversum,’
were to have long flowing hair and beards, and were each to carry a staff and scrip.
Singing this hymn, and slowly marching down the right aisle, they came to the
western porch, where they put themselves at the head of the procession of choristers
waiting for them, and all began together to sing, ‘Nos tuo vultu saties.’ Then
the priest for the day, robed in alb and surplice, bare-footed, carrying a cross on
his right shoulder, advanced to meet them, and ‘standing suddenly before them,’
asked, ‘What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as
ye talk and are sad?’ To which the two pilgrims replied, ‘Art thou a stranger
in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in
these days?’</p>

<p>‘What things,’ asked the priest. ‘Concerning Jesus of Nazareth,’ they replied,
with the words which follow. ‘Oh, fools!’ said the priest, ‘and slow of heart to
believe all that the prophets have spoken.’ And then, feigning to retire, the priest
would there have left them, but they held him back, and pointing to the ‘castellum,’
entreated him to enter, singing, ‘Abide with us for it is towards evening and the
day is far spent.’ Then singing another hymn, they led him to the ‘Fort of
Emmaus,’ which they entered, and where they sat down at a table already spread
for supper. Here the priest brake bread sitting between them, and being
recognised by this act for the Lord, ‘suddenly vanished out of their sight.’ The
pilgrims, pretending to be stupefied, arose and sang sorrowfully (<i lang="la">lamentabiliter</i>)
‘Alleluia,’ with the verse, ‘Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with
us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?’ Singing this twice
they walked to the pulpit, where they sang the verse, ‘Dic nobis Maria.’ After
this, another priest, dressed in a dalmatic and surplice, with head muffled up like a
woman, came to them and sang, ‘Sepulcrum Christi Angelicos testes.’ He then
took up a cloth from one place, and a second from another place, and threw them
before the great door of the choir. And (the directions conclude) then let him
sing, ‘Christ has risen,’ and let the choir chaunt the two other verses which follow,
and let the women and the pilgrims retire within: and the memory of this act being
thus recalled, let the procession return to the choir, and the vespers be finished.”</p>

<p>There was also the pilgrimage of punishment, when a criminal was condemned
to wander up and down the road whithersoever the Pope should direct him. There
were many of those poor wretches to be met with on the road; most of them were
murderers; a chain was made in which was worked up the sword or knife or other
weapon with which the crime was committed; the neck, arms, and body of the
criminal were bound round with this chain; so equipped, the malefactor toiled
painfully from shrine to shrine, living on alms. It was not until the fourteenth
century that the practice was discontinued. Can anything prove more abundantly
the power of the Church than this punishment of murderers, who were simply loaded
with these chains and then commanded to go forth on a pilgrimage from shrine to
shrine? There was no police to enforce obedience; there was no guard set over
the criminals; they were told to go and walk to a certain shrine and there to await
further orders; and they obeyed.</p>

<p>There were two kinds of pilgrimage: <i lang="la">peregrinatio major</i> and <i lang="la">peregrinatio minor</i>.
Of the former kind were those to the Holy Land and to Rome. Of the latter kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
those which generally satisfied our ancestors, were those to Walsingham with
its Virgin, Glastonbury with its holy thorn, Waltham with its black cross,
St. Edmund’s Bury with the body of the King, Durham with the shrine of
St. Cuthbert, Chichester with that of St. Richard; there were also Beverley,
Winchester, Lincoln, York, Peterborough—all famous shrines. The two places
most popular were the Walsingham and the Canterbury pilgrimages. But in
thinking of Chaucer’s immortal company we must remember that such companies
left London daily in the summer bound for one or other of these holy places. In
the illogical confusion of things belonging to the period the pilgrimage which for
many was an orgy and a period of unbounded license all the way, was coupled with
prayers devout and tears unfeigned.</p>

<p>It would be idle to look too closely into the accounts of pilgrimages for
evidences of the religious spirit among the pilgrims. Yet such evidences are found,
notably in the fervent prayers and praises of Felix Fabri, who will be mentioned
immediately. It is sufficient to remember that with the great mass of the people
religion consisted in obedience. They had but to do what the Church ordered.
After death there would be purgatory. Pilgrimage and other observances
shortened the period of purgatory. They went, therefore, partly with that object,
partly with the desire of seeing strange countries, partly to work off the restlessness
that falls upon men, as upon nations, from time to time.</p>

<p>Wyclyf, William of Langland, Chaucer, Gower, all the mediæval writers,
continually make allusions to pilgrims. Sometimes the life of pilgrimage is
ridiculed. Thus William of Langland speaks of the “crowd of hermits with hooked
staves, who wend to Walsingham and their wenches after them, boobies who are
unable to labour, clothe themselves in cloaks to be known from the others, and
become hermits for their ease.” Sometimes the tales of the pilgrims are derided.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Pylgrimis and palmers plyghten hem to-gederes,</div>
   <div class="verse">To seche saint Jame and seyntys of Rome,</div>
   <div class="verse">Wenten forth in hure way with many un-wyse tales,</div>
   <div class="verse">And heven leve to lye al hure lyf-tyme.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thorpe (Skeat’s <cite>Notes to Chaucer</cite>, p. 49), when examined by Arundel, Archbishop
of Canterbury, in 1407, complains of the pilgrims, saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> “They will ordain
to have with them both men and women that can well sing wanton songs: and
some other pilgrims will have with them bagpipes: so that every town that they
come through, what with the noise of their singing, and with the sound of their
piping, and with the jangling of their Canterbury bells, and with the barking out
of dogs after them, they make more noise than if the King came there away,
with all his clarions and many other minstrels. And if these men and women
be a moneth in their pilgrimage, many of them shall be an half year after, great
jangelers, tale-tellers, and lyers.”</p>

<p>But the Archbishop said, “Leude Losell, Thou seest not ferre ynough in this
matter, for thou considerest not the great trauel of pilgremys, therefore thou
blamest the thing that is praisable. I say to thee that it is right well done that
pilgremys have with them both syngers and also pypers, that whan one of them
that goeth barfoote striketh his toe upon a stone and hurteth hym sore, and makyth
him to blede; it is well done that he or his felow begyn then a songe, or else take
out of his bosom a baggepipe for to drive away with suche myrthe the hurt of his
felow. For with soche solace the trauel and weeriness of pilgremys is lightely and
merily broughte forth.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the people invented saints and shrines for themselves, as when
they flocked to the tomb of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, a man far removed from
the saintly life, or to that of Simon de Montfort. In 1338 a grocer of London sold
a mazer ornamented with the image of St. Thomas of Lancaster. And a few years
later the people made a saint of the preacher and hermit Richard Rolle of Hampole.
All these popular but ephemeral saints worked miracles abundantly while the faith
in their power lasted. Would that some poet had depicted the swarm of pilgrims
who, in the year when the grocer sold that mazer, rode out of London on a
pilgrimage to Pontefract where St. Thomas of Lancaster was buried!</p>

<p>Not only must men get a license to go on a pilgrimage: the shipmen
who carried them were also licensed. Pilgrims to foreign parts went either to
Calais and thence by land, or, if they were going to Compostella, they went all the
way by sea. Thus, the ship called <i lang="fr">La Charité de Paynton</i>, Peter Cok, Captain, was
licensed to carry a hundred pilgrims. “Le Petre de Dartemouth” was licensed for
sixty, “La Marie de Southampton” for one hundred, “Le Thomas de Saltash”
for sixty, and so on.</p>

<p>In the narrative of Felix Fabri (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1484) pilgrims to the Holy Land (see
<cite>Palestine Pilgrims Text Society</cite>, vols. vii.-x.) we can read how the long pilgrimages
were conducted on board ship. Felix sailed from Venice. The methods were
much the same for pilgrims from every country, except that the ships which had
to cross the Bay of Biscay, and to sail round the headlands of Portugal, were
probably stouter than those which sailed in the Mediterranean alone.</p>

<p>The pilgrim paid so much for the voyage there and back: he was also taken
to the Holy Places under escort. A special contract was entered into with each
party. Thus, that of Felix consisted of twelve, viz. four noble Lords and eight
attendants, viz. a kind of general manager or courier, a barber and musician, an old
soldier for a manservant, a bourgeois for manciple, a cook, an ex-trader who had
been a galley slave and acted as interpreter, a “man of peace,” who was a schoolmaster
by profession, and Felix himself, Priest of the Order of Preaching Friars.
The articles of the contract were, in brief, these—the party were to be conveyed
from Venice to Joppa and back again. They were to receive two full meals a day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
with a cup of malvoisie every morning before breakfast; they were to be protected
from ill-usage by the galley slaves; they were to be taken to see all the Holy
places; and they were to pay forty ducats a head. The value of the ducat at this
time I cannot pretend to estimate. There were gold ducats and silver ducats;
ducats of Hungary, Austria, Hamburg and Italy.</p>

<p>On the weighing of the anchors, the Germans sang together the Pilgrims’
Hymn:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“In Gottes Namen fahren wir:</div>
   <div class="verse">Seiner Gnaden begehren wir:</div>
   <div class="verse">Nun helff uns die Gottliche Kraft und das Heilige Geist:</div>
   <div class="verse">Kyrie Eleison!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It would be pleasant to know the words of the English Pilgrims’ Hymn on
arrival within sight of Joppa, when they all sang together, led by two priests.
There were many nations represented on board the ship, Italians, Lombards, Gauls,
Franks, Germans, English, Irish, Scots, Hungarians, Dacians, Bohemians, Spaniards,
and they joined together in the “Hymn of Ambrose and Augustine,” <i>i.e.</i> the <i lang="la">Te
Deum Laudamus</i>.</p>

<p>As for the life on board, the inconveniences, the insects, the turbulent slaves,
the sea-sickness, Felix spares us nothing. The earliest of our sea songs, belonging
to nearly the same date, is an account of a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Iago
of Compostella. It is evidently the work of one who writes from experience. The
ship is filled with pilgrims, and they are all sea-sick together:—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The itinerary of two pilgrimages made by one English traveller still remains,
and has been published by the Roxburghe Club. His name was William Wey,
Bachelor of Divinity, formerly fellow of the Royal College of the most Blessed Mary
at Eton beside Windsor. He travelled twice to Jerusalem, in 1458 and in 1462, and
once to St. James of Compostella in 1465. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> “consecratus ad modum
peregrinorum,” set apart by the special service: he received the license of the
King, so that he was not to lose his fellowship by unauthorised absence; he left
Eton to join the Augustines of Hedington, or Edinton; he made his last pilgrimage
in the seventieth year of his age; and he died in the monastery in the year 1476
aged eighty-six. Evidently a strong man. He bequeathed, or gave, to the
Brethren of Hedington, a great collection of valuable relics and curiosities from the
Holy Land.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he tells nothing of the start or the return, beginning his
pilgrimage at Venice. Here there was a regular service of ships, where captains
undertook to do the “round trip”—to Jerusalem and back—for so much.</p>

<p>When he went to St. James of Compostella, there was a pilgrim fleet of six
ships which sailed from Plymouth, viz. from Portsmouth, Bristol, Weymouth,
Lymington, Plymouth—called the <i>Mary White</i>, and others—was this the annual
pilgrim fleet? or was it only one of many such fleets?</p>

<p>The itineraries of Wey illustrate the comparative ease with which people
travelled at that time. It was a long way to Palestine, but not too long for a man
of seventy to undertake. The traveller relates stories of purses cut and jewels
stolen, but there is no sense of other dangers or of any terrors: the pilgrims were
taken on board; they were carried to the port; they were landed; they were conducted
under escort to their shrines; and they were brought home again. It is
noticeable that Wey’s two companions on his first pilgrimage were priests like
himself. In Chaucer’s time, as is well known, all who could afford the time and
money went on pilgrimage. Thus the wife of Bath:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent2">“Thrice hadde sche ben at Jerusalem:</div>
   <div class="verse">Sche hadde passed many a strange stream:</div>
   <div class="verse">At Rome she hadde been and at Bologne:</div>
   <div class="verse">In Galice at Seynt James and at Cologne.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One imagines that the long civil wars and the widespread Lollardy, which was
only silenced, not killed, interfered with the practice of pilgrimage in the fifteenth
century. On the other hand, Erasmus shows us that the pilgrims to English shrines,
at least, were numerous in his time. The regular service of personally conducted
pilgrimages to Venice and back proves that pilgrimage to the Holy Land was not
diverted or interrupted, in spite of war raging all around.</p>

<p>At every shrine the pilgrim bought or was presented with a sign to show that
he had been there. These signs were cast in pewter or in lead. A pilgrim who
had been to many shrines came home with his cap or his coat covered with these
emblems. Thus Chaucer says (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, xxxviii. p. 130):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent2">“Then as manere and custom is, signes there they bought,</div>
   <div class="verse">For men of contre should know whome they had sought:</div>
   <div class="verse">Eche man set his silver in such thing as they liked,</div>
   <div class="verse">And in the meen while the miller had y-piked</div>
   <div class="verse">His bosom ful of signs of Canterbury brochis.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>
<p>Afterwards</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“They set their signys upon their hedes, and some upon their capp,</div>
   <div class="verse">And sith to the dynerward they gan for to stapp.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Erasmus makes Menedemus ask, “What kind of attire is this that thou
wearest? Thou art bedizened with semicircular shells, each full of images of tin
and lead, and adorned with straw chains, and thy arm is girt with a bracelet of
beads.” The reply is that he has been to certain shrines on pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary insignia of pilgrimage (see Skeat’s Notes to <cite>Piers
Plowman</cite>), every pilgrimage had its special signs, which the pilgrim on his return
wore conspicuously upon his hat or his scrip, or hanging round his neck, in token
that he had accomplished that particular pilgrimage. Thus the ampullæ were the
special signs of the Canterbury pilgrimage; the scallop-shell was the sign of the
pilgrimage to Compostella (shrine of St. James in Galicia); whilst the signs of the
Roman pilgrimage were a badge with the effigies of St. Peter and St. Paul, the
cross-keys (keys-of-Rome) and the vernicle. The vernicle was a copy of the
handkerchief of St. Veronica, which was miraculously impressed with the features
of our Lord.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Hugo communicated to the Society of Antiquaries a paper on this
subject, accompanied by several specimens found on the banks of the Thames.
Remember, in examining these, that the greater number of people went about the
streets adorned with these emblems. (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, xxxviii.)</p>

<p>We might expect that, as was the custom with one of the duties required of the
faithful, so it would happen with others. Thus, since the soul was saved by means
of prayer and praise, it mattered little who sang or said those prayers, and a rich
man could endow a priest in perpetuity to say prayers for his soul every day. In
the same way, since a pilgrimage was in itself a most meritorious action, and equal
to many masses, a man might pay others to go on a pilgrimage for him. This, in
fact, was done. We find bequests of money for pilgrimages. One merchant of
London bequeathed sixty gold scudi to be given to some one who would undertake,
in the name of the testator, and for the good of the testator’s soul, to go on a
pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre and the sacred places of Jerusalem. Another
left money with the object of getting credit for going to the convent of Mount Sinai:
while many left smaller sums for pilgrimages to Santiago di Compostella and the
Blessed Virgin of Walsingham. Were there, one asks, professional pilgrims? Did
men painfully work through the exercises at shrine after shrine, all for the good of
souls stranger to themselves? Was there no way by which they might divert the
intention of the testator and reap for the benefit of their own souls these accumulations
of merits and good deeds?</p>

<p>When we think of a London pilgrim, one of two pictures presents itself. We
either see the companies assembling at the Tabard Inn bound for the shrine of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Thomas of Canterbury, or we see the smaller and more serious party bound for the
Holy Sepulchre and the sacred places of Jerusalem. All our views of the mediæval
life are curiously narrowed by the influence of Chaucer. So strong and fine is the
light thrown upon the Canterbury Pilgrims and those to Palestine that we have
forgotten the many other shrines to which the pilgrim fared in search of a blessing
and the remission of his sins.</p>

<div class="caption">THE TABARD INN, BOROUGH<br />

</div>

<p>But besides the English shrines already mentioned, there were other local ones
for the Londoner. There was the shrine of Our Lady of Crome’s Hill, Greenwich,
or that of the Holy Rood of Bermondsey, or that of Our Lady of Willesden, or
that of Our Lady of Muswell, or that of “Our Lady that standeth in the Oke.”
The last-named place of pilgrimage was somewhere between Highgate and Islington.
May its name be supposed to linger in the modern form of Gospel Oak? The
whole country, in fact, was studded all over with shrines of local celebrity. Outside
London, no one, for instance, knew or cared about Our Lady of Muswell: but to
Londoners she was a very real saint, to whom multitudes paid pilgrimage. Of these
minor shrines, concerning which Chaucer is silent, which Erasmus never visited,
there are very few historical notices extant. When they were suppressed and the
images themselves burned, there was no one left to care about the records and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
papers connected with them, so they, too, were burned, or they were left to moulder
in the muniment chest.</p>

<p>Or, if the Londoner wanted a pilgrimage with little personal exertion, which
might be performed in a single day, he could choose between the shrine of Edward
the Confessor at Westminster, a place of the greatest sanctity: that of St. Erkenwald
in St. Paul’s, also regarded as most powerful and efficacious: there were two
feasts of St. Erkenwald: on these days all the clergy of the diocese repaired to
the shrine robed in their copes: special indulgences were granted to those who
visited this shrine.</p>

<p>The three shrines north of London, now so completely forgotten, all lay in the
heart of the great Middlesex Forest. Each of the miraculous images was probably
a Lady of the Oak: there was Our Lady of the Oak all over Europe. The
miraculous figure is always found in an oak, and is always, it is said, <em>black</em>. Thus,
Our Lady of Puy in France, supposed to be the most ancient of these figures, is
described as being carved out of cedar, swathed round and round with fine linen like
a mummy, deep black, the face and features extremely long, the eyes small and
formed of glass, the look haggard and wild (<cite>L. and M. Archæological Trans.</cite> iv.
178); and there is a Black Virgin at Marseilles.</p>

<p>These shrines were near enough for a single day’s journey: a pleasant
summer’s ride through the gardens and orchards of Islington where the Forest
began, and so over the greensward and under the branches of the wood to the
clearing on the top of Muswell Hill, where now stands the Alexandra Palace, and
then stood the chapel containing the black image swathed with linen, crowned,
decked with gold and jewels, before which stood the altar and burned the lamp day
and night. Every day through the summer came the penitents, the sick, the jovial
pilgrims, who only wanted to put in a plea for indulgence. Outside the chapel
there were taverns and merry-making places. First the pilgrim knelt at the shrine;
sometimes he went round it on his knees; and prayed, with simple belief, if not with
fervour; faith made the sick man whole; faith absolved the penitent; faith made
the most careless happy in the belief that Our Lady of Muswell had knocked off
many—he knew not how many—years of purgatory. The religious act finished,
no one objected to pleasure and merriment. There are indications that the
merriment was not always seemly, nor was the pleasure always sinless. Yet
pilgrimage continued because the sick who had been healed spread abroad the story
of their miraculous cures, and because everybody wanted to get out of purgatory as
quickly as possible, and because it was a most delightful form of holiday and
recreation.</p>

<p>The Lollards preached against pilgrimages continually; a fact charged against
them by the Church time after time. Thus, when a Lollard named William Dynet
had to abjure his Lollardy in the year 1395, he swore that thenceforth he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
worship images and that he would never more despise pilgrimages. A hundred and
forty years more the worship of images had to continue in the land. Piers Plowman
speaks with contempt of the sham holiness of pilgrims in words already quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Heremytes in an heep with hoked staves,</div>
   <div class="verse">Wenten to Walsingham and their wenches after.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Later on, one Father Donald, a Scotch Friar, said, preaching, “Ye men of
London, gang on yourself with your wives to Willesden, or else keep them at home
with you in sorrow.”</p>

<p>In the year 1509, when there occurred a fire in Willesden Church, which damaged
the sacred image, one Elizabeth, wife of John Sampson, citizen, got into trouble for
expressing a not unnatural doubt of the power of the image to help others when she
could not help herself. “If Our Lady of Willesden might have holpen men and
women which go to her of pilgrimage, she would not have suffered her own tayle
(taille) to have been burnt.”</p>

<p>She had to abjure these sentiments publicly. But if the ordinary citizens’ wives
commonly talked in this manner, the way was surely rapidly being prepared for the
Reformation. In 1530—very shortly before the end—one Dr. Crown, being
questioned as to heresy, said, “I will say again, do your duty and then your
devotion ... when thou comest at the Day of Judgment, He will not say unto
thee ‘why wentest thou not to Wilsdon a pilgrimage?’ He will say unto thee
‘I was an hungred and thou gavest me no meat: I was nakyd and thou gavest
me no clothys’: and soche lyke.”</p>

<p>In September 1538 all the images—those of Walsingham, Ipswich, Worcester,
the Lady of Willesden, the Lady of Muswell, the Lady “that standeth in the Oak,”
and many others—were brought up to London and publicly burned at Chelsea. Then
the Fair, which went on all through the summer, with noisy taverns, drunken men,
disorderly women, music, dancing, singing, tumblers, and minstrels, at Willesden,
Muswell, and other unknown places “in the Oake,” came to a sudden end. Silence
set in, and Willesden Church became the church of a little secluded village in the
midst of the Forest; the road to Muswell through the woods became overgrown and
forgotten, and nobody in the next generation knew where stood the oak with its
sacred image, which had attracted so many thousands every year.</p>

<p>Besides these shrines of London, with their miraculous Virgins, there were the
Holy and wonder-working Roods, of which the most important seems to have been
that of Bermondsey Abbey. There were, also, objects of pilgrimage, of votive
offering, and of prayer, the Holy Wells of which some 500 have been enumerated
in England, and round London no fewer than sixteen. The origin of Holy Wells is
a subject that belongs to archæology and scholarship; nor indeed is this the place for
an examination into the subject. Streams, rivers, fountains, springs, have all been
accounted holy, and possessed each its nymph or its god, who demanded sacrifice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Wells were dressed with flowers: they were used for divination; long before
Christianity newly-born children were passed through water; coins have been
found by the hundred in wells where they were thrown in order to read an oracle
from the troubling of the waters; there were superstitions about the springs; there
were superstitions about water drawn on certain nights; there were wishing wells;
there were wakes of the well; it was in some places held necessary that converts
should be baptized in clear running water. Wells cured different diseases: one
was good for the eye, and one for the ear. Wells sprung up miraculously to mark
the site of a martyrdom, and so on.</p>

<p>The holy wells of London were as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Clerkenwell. This well, where the parish clerks held their plays, was
situated at the edge of Clerkenwell Green and on the south-east corner of Ray
Street. The Green stretched north-west of St. John’s Priory Church.</p>

<p>2. St. Chad’s Well. The site of this well, which had medicinal qualities, was
just south of the present King’s Cross Station on the Metropolitan Line.</p>

<p>3. St. Clement’s Well was north of St. Clement’s Church, close to Clement’s
Inn.</p>

<p>4. Islington. Here was a very holy spring, greatly believed in for its restorative
qualities. It was on the site of Sadler’s Wells Theatre.</p>

<p>5. Hampstead. The Holy Well of Hampstead was that called afterwards the
Shepherd’s Well, which is now represented by a drinking fountain in Fitzjohn’s
Avenue.</p>

<p>6. Muswell Hill. Besides the wonder-working Virgin of Muswell Hill, there
was the Well of St. Lazarus. The name implies that it was used by lepers.
Robert Bruce tried to cure his leprosy by bathing in its waters.</p>

<p>7. Kensington Gardens. Here was the Well of St. Gover, where, until a few
years ago, an attendant still dispensed the waters of the well.</p>

<p>8. St. Pancras Well was on the north side of St. Pancras Church.</p>

<p>9. At Tottenham there were two wells—that of St. Loy or St. Eloy, and that
called the Bishops’ Well.</p>

<p>10. Skinner’s Well was not far from Clerks’ Well, which is all the information
one has about it. The same may be said of Todwell, Faggeswell, Loders Well,
and Radwell, all now filled up and forgotten. The site of the Holy Well was
preserved until recently in the street of that name.</p>

<p>11. At Shoreditch there was the Well of St. John; not far from Shoreditch in
Old Street, north of Tabernacle Square, was the spring of St. Agnes le Clair, called
also Dame Annice, the Clear and Anniseed Clere.</p>

<small>ORDEAL</small></h3>


<p>Trial by ordeal was always possible in London, yet, in later years, rarely practised.
The reason of its rarity was, no doubt, the fact that the accused person was in most
cases the guilty person. In an age when the judgment of God could be solemnly
invoked, when there was absolute belief in the punishments and tortures reserved
for the guilty, a man would, as a general rule, hesitate before loading his soul,
heavy with the actual crime, with perjuries and the blasphemy of calling upon an
offended God to prove his innocence; to invite, that is, the Father of Justice
himself to deliver a false judgment. It was this clear and unquestioning faith which
made the trial by ordeal possible for the innocent man to claim, and generally
impossible for the guilty.</p>

<p>There were many kinds of ordeal.</p>

<p>The first was the ordeal called the corsned, <i>i.e.</i> the eating of a small cake of
consecrated barley bread. The accused called upon the Lord God to choke him
with it if he were guilty. It was believed that in this case his throat would become
contracted and his jaws fixed. It was so that Earl Godwin was said to have been
adjudged guilty and choked by the Hand of Justice which he had invoked.</p>

<p>The second method, long practised in the case of witches, was the ordeal of
cold water. The accused was stripped, his hands were tied crosswise to his feet; he
was sprinkled with holy water; he was permitted to kiss the cross; a rope was tied
around his waist, and at the distance of two ells from his body a knot was tied; he
was then thrown into deep water; if he sank as deep as the knot he was innocent;
if not, he was guilty. The administration of the ordeal was not conducted in the
bare and simple method indicated above: it was placed in the hands of priests;
mass was said before it; there were appropriate psalms and prayers; the accused
confessed his sins to the priest; before the whole congregation he called upon God
to prove his innocence; he swore upon the holy relics of the church that he was
innocent. The function was one of great solemnity, and calculated to impress the
minds of the people most deeply.</p>

<p>The ordeal by hot water was, it will be seen, as a mere ceremony, most remarkable.
One case will stand for many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>Four men, all belonging to the Ward of Chepe, were accused of robbery and
murder; the dead body of the murdered man had been found lying near the
Standard in Chepe stripped, and showing gaping wounds; the four men were
known to be “roreres,” that is, night wanderers and brawlers; the evidence against
them, chiefly circumstantial, warranted their arrest; they claimed to prove their
innocence by the ordeal of boiling water.</p>

<p>On the appointed day they were brought out from Newgate and conducted to
St. Sepulchre’s Church, where they first confessed and then attended mass, being
placed in the body of the church before the altar screen. After mass a short
special service was sung for them; they then, one after the other, swore upon
the relics that they were innocent; they demanded, singly and one after the
other, the proof by ordeal; they solemnly implored the Lord to make manifest
their innocence if they were innocent, or to prove their guilt if they were guilty.
This done, a procession was formed. The whifflers marched first, followed by
the clergy and the singing boys. Then came the prisoners guarded by the
sergeant.</p>

<p>They were led out to Smithfield followed by a great crowd; the ordeal was not
a function that could be witnessed every day; the Londoners have always turned
out in force to witness an execution, or a flogging, or pillory, or any act of justice.
On Smithfield, at the east of the Elms, that is, nearly in front of Bartholomew’s
Hospital, a fire of wood was burning in an open grate; upon this stood a caldron
full of water; the smoke of the fire rolled up round the caldron and was blown
hither and thither; with it ascended, or was blown about, the steam of the boiling
water; the flames crackled and licked the black sides of the caldron, the water
bubbled and overflowed and hissed. Behind the caldron was a gibbet, with ropes
for four. It was afterwards observed that of the four men one preserved a cheerful
and confident air, the other three were haggard and wan; their limbs dragged as
they went.</p>

<p>Arrived at the spot the Sheriff, who was present with the Alderman of Chepe,
informed the prisoners—which they knew already—that at the bottom of the
caldron lay a round white stone; they would each have to dip an arm into the
boiling water and bring out that stone without scalding themselves.</p>

<p>The first to essay the adventure was the prisoner of the cheerful and the
confident countenance; the guards took off his doublet; they rolled a thin piece of
linen round his arm and sealed it with lead. They then bade him advance. He
stepped forward; he stood beside the caldron, his arm raised; the Priest and
singing men began a Psalm.</p>

<p>The smoke and the steam blew this way and that way; the man could not be
seen sometimes for the fumes; when the wind blew aside, the people saw him still,
hand upraised, watching the boiling water. Suddenly the smoke and the steam were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
blown aside; he plunged his arm; the smoke was blown back again; but he stood
before the officers, the white stone in his hand.</p>

<p>The crowd shouted. The Lord had proved his innocence.</p>

<p>He was set aside; he would be taken back to Newgate; three days afterwards,
the covering would be taken from his arm, and if there were no signs of scalding
he would be set free.</p>

<p>The next man stepped forward.</p>

<p>He plunged his hand at once; he groped about for the stone; he drew out his
hand; he plunged again; he drew it out with a yell of agony. No need to look at
the arm searchingly, it was horribly scalded. They hanged him up at once.</p>

<p>The third man was brought forward.</p>

<p>He looked at his companion hanging; he looked at the caldron and the fire.
He fell on his knees confessing the crime.</p>

<p>So, likewise, did the fourth man.</p>

<p>So, out of four ropes, three were wanted; and for four of them who were
accused, the Lord Himself had pronounced the guilt of three and established the
innocence of one.</p>

<p>The fourth method was the ordeal by fire, in which the accused had to lift a red-hot
bar of iron without burning his hands, or to walk barefoot over red-hot iron; or
to put his hand into a red-hot iron glove; or to pass through a blazing fire with his
clothes untouched. In the case of the bar of red-hot iron, the trial took place in the
church, and as soon as mass was begun the bar was placed in the coals; at the last
collect it was taken off. A stand of some kind was placed near the fire, then a space
of nine times the length of the prisoner’s foot was measured off; this made a
distance of about seven or eight feet. This space was divided by lines into three.
The prisoner had to lift up the bar and to carry it by three steps across the space.
His hand was then bound up, and after three days it was examined. If it showed
signs of burning he was hanged.</p>

<p>These kinds of ordeal naturally fell into disuse as soon as people began to
suspect that there was “management” by the priests; their suspicions began
certainly as early as the time of William Rufus, and perhaps earlier. The
Normans, indeed, scoffed at all the old ordeals. On one occasion, when twenty
prisoners had successfully passed the ordeal by fire, William Rufus laughed at the
whole business and ordered them all to be tried. But the ordeal by battle stood on
a different footing. In this ordeal there could be no deception and no bribing; the
priest had nothing to do with it; the two parties had to fight it out to the death; it
was conducted in grim and solemn earnest; it was an appeal and a heartfelt prayer
to the Lord of Justice. He was called upon to show the world which was the guilty
party. And just as in the ordeal by water, the consciousness of innocence gave a
man assurance, and thereby enabled him to undertake the fearful task without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
confusion or haste, so in the Ordeal by Battle, the consciousness of innocence sent a
man into the field doubly armed.</p>

<p>The mediæval view of the Ordeal by Battle is set forth seriously and solemnly
by Dante (<cite>De Monarchia</cite>, book ii. chap. x.)<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Moreover, what is acquired by ordeal is acquired by Right. For wheresoever human judgment
is at fault, either because it is involved in the darkness of ignorance or because there is not a presiding
judge, then, lest justice should be left deserted, we must have recourse to Him, who so loved her as
Himself to meet her demands with His own blood in death. Hence the psalm, ‘Just is the Lord, and
deeds of justice hath he loved.’ Now this is what takes place when by the free assent of either side, not
in hatred but in love of justice the divine judgment is sought through means of the mutual clash of
strength, alike of mind and body. Which clash, since it was first tried in the single contact of man and
man, we call the ordeal.</p>

<p>But we must ever take heed that like as, when it is a question of war, all means should first be
tried in the way of award, and only in the last resort should the way of battle be tried (as Tully and
Vegetius agree in saying, the one in <cite>Re militari</cite>, the other in the <cite>De Officiis</cite>), and like as in medical
treatment, everything else should be tried before steel and fire, and they only in the last resort; so when
every other way of finding judgment in a dispute has been exhausted, we are to recur in the last resort
to this remedy, forced by a kind of compulsion of justice.</p>

<p>There are then two formal characteristics of the ordeal: one is that which has just now been spoken
of; the other the one which was touched upon above, to wit, that the contenders or champions should
enter the palæstra, not in hate or love, but in sole zeal for justice, with common consent. And therefore
Tully said well in dealing with this matter, but wars, the aim of which is the crown of Empire,
should be waged less bitterly.</p>

<p>But if the formal characteristics of the ordeal are preserved (else were it no ordeal) are not they who
have gathered together by common consent, under compulsion of justice and in zeal for her, gathered
together in the name of God? And if so, is not God in their midst, since He himself promises as much
in the Evangel? And if God is present, is it not impious to think that justice may succumb?—justice
whom He so loves as is forenoted above! And if justice cannot succumb in the ordeal is not that which
is acquired by ordeal acquired by Right?”</p></blockquote>

<p>A Function, or an Act of Worship, undertaken and carried out in this spirit,
cannot be regarded otherwise than most seriously. Let us turn to the actual
manner in which the Ordeal by Battle was conducted.</p>

<p>The accused began by denying the whole accusation word by word. He then
offered to prove his innocence by his body. If the Judge accepted the offer and
decided that the duel should take place, he made the parties exchange gloves.
They then had to find pledges that they would appear on the day of battle. Fines
were paid to the King for permission to fight, for recreancy on failure to appear, for
refusing to fight, for not holding the ordeal properly, or as a bribe to allow a fight.</p>

<p>For the following rules in the preparation of the ground, I am indebted to the
learned pen of my friend Prof. Skeat, whose Notes to his <cite>Chaucer</cite> and his <cite>Piers
Plowman</cite> are a treasure-house of learning:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“The King shall find the field to fight in, and the lists shall be made and devised by the constable;
and it is to be observed, that the list must be 60 paces long and 40 paces broad, set up in good order,
and the ground within hard, stable, and level, without any great stones or other impediments; also, that
the lists must be made with one door to the east, and another to the west; and strongly barred about
with good bars 7 feet high or more, so that a horse may not be able to leap over them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It appears that there were an immense number of ordeals by battle; indeed, in
such an age, when every man was a soldier, one can very well understand that this
method would seem to an innocent man far superior to any form of trial. In one
year of Henry the Second’s reign, there were thirty-four ordeals. Not only to an
innocent man, but to the guilty the ordeal by battle commended itself; many a
sturdy rogue, having little fear of God’s vengeance before his eyes, preferred the
chance of battle to the certainty of the gallows; so much was this the case that
criminals were sometimes pardoned on condition of fighting so many battles
successfully and ridding the country of so many malefactors. The ordeal by battle
brought into existence, as might have been expected, a kind of gladiator, the
champion or hired fighter, who risked his neck with every fight.</p>

<p>In the case of knights, we see that the weapons were those in customary use,
and the duel was a fight with spears and with sword; in the case of the common
sort, it was a very different thing. The gallows stood in readiness for the
vanquished man; the weapons were staves armed at the end with iron shaped like
a ram’s horn. There was a strict rule about the dress of the combatants, which
was to be of white wool; they were bare-headed and bare-footed; their heads were
shaved to avoid giving a chance for either to catch the other by the hair. In a
certain duel on record the combatants first broke their staves and then fought with
fists and claws and feet and teeth, especially with their teeth; they tore each other’s
garments and the flesh beneath, until at last one got the other down and gouged
out both eyes with his thumbs. After this there was nothing to be done but to
surrender and to be carried to the gallows there to be hanged.</p>

<p>In the year 1350, just after the visitation of the Black Death, occurred the
famous Ordeal by Battle between John de Viscomte and Thomas de la Marche.
The quarrel arose in the East, where both these knights were engaged in the war
then going on between the Armenians, the Cypriotes, and the Rhodians on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
side, and the Saracens on the other. John de Viscomte was a cousin of the King
of Cyprus and Thomas de la Marche was a natural son of Philippe de Valois, King
of France. Charges were brought by the former that the said Thomas had been
guilty of perjury, treason, and forgery. The particulars of the accusation do not
concern us. Thomas denied the whole and challenged the accuser to single combat.
It is not exactly clear why the battle was not fought out in Cyprus or in Rhodes;
probably both parties desired to make as much as possible of the quarrel and of
the battle; probably the case was felt to be one which interested the whole of
Christendom; however that may be, it was agreed to refer the matter to the King
of England as the most worthy and honourable Prince in all Christendom. The
knights, therefore, arrived in England at the beginning of September 1350 with
letters from the Kings of Armenia and Cyprus containing a statement of the
case, and inviting the King to allow the Ordeal by Battle to take place in his
presence.</p>

<p>The day was fixed for the 4th of October; the battle to be fought out in
the Lists in his Palace of Westminster. The combatants appeared on the day
appointed, fully armed and on horseback. The King, the Prince of Wales, and a
great concourse of people were present. The oaths were administered and the
battle began. Sir John, leaping from his horse, determined to fight on foot; in
which he was followed by his adversary. Stow says that they began by running
“at the tilte.” The following is Stow’s account of the fight, with the tragical
conclusion:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“For this therefore were these two worthy souldiers appointed to fight, which they performed within
the listes of the King’s pallace at Westminster, on Mondaye nexte following after the feaste of Saint
Michael, where Thomas, in declaration of hys innocencie, in that he was accused of, overcame his enemie,
but yet killed him not, for he could not, because he was not able to wounde hym beyng so armed, with
anye kynde of piercing weapon, except it were in hys face whiche was bare. For after that they hadde
runne at the Tilte, and foughte on foote, as they were striving together on the grounde, wyth certaine
prickes bothe shorte and sharpe, then called Gadlings, being closed in the joints of his right gauntlet, the
sayde Thomas struck the sayde John in the face, and sore wounded hym: but on the other side John
hadde no suche kinde of weapon, wherewyth hee myght hurte Thomas face, and therefore cryed out aloude
moste horribly, wherupon by the King’s commaundemente the combatte was ended, and the victory
adiudged to Thomas, who gave the sayde John being thus overcome, to the Prince of Wales for a Captive,
and offered up his owne armoure to Sainte George in Sainte Paules Churche at London, wyth great
devotion. These matters beyng thus finished, the Cipres man is manumitted and sette at libertie as a
free man againe. And Thomas thinking boldly to goe into the presence of his brother the Frenche King,
toke hys journey thyther, and at his coming, founde the sayde King and the nobilitie of Fraunce greatlye
offended, and in indignation against him, for that he agreed that the combat shoulde be tried before the
King of England. Wherefore Thomas thinking secretly with him selfe howe to winne the false friendship
of his brother, became desirous to shewe that therein he hadde done well among all other things he
greatelye praysed the nobilitie of Edwarde and his worthy fame spredde over all the worlde, and also the
justice whiche he used in judging, not accepting the person of the manne of Cipres (yea thoughe he loved
the Kyng himselfe verye well), neyther suffered him to be preferred before me, which am a French manne,
and brother, and friende to thee my Lorde Kyng of Fraunce, judge over the sayde King Edwarde my
adversarie. Also the Earle of Ewe highly praysed the King of England, for that he hadde receyved greate
comforte and commoditye at hys handes during the tyme of hys Captivitie in Englande, shewing also howe
farre that good Kyng hadde banished envie and hatred from hys hearte, who at a time of justyng beyng in
the fielde at that exercise, and the Kyng also, was commaunded by the Kyng himselfe to beare awaye the
price and pricke from them all. These commendations did the French Kyng envie at, and for indignation,
he most wickedlye commaunded the setters forth of those prayses to be beheaded. And for to colour
the matter the better he fayned that the Earle used too much familiaritie with the Queene his wife, and
that his brother was guiltie of treason against the King of Fraunce, bycause he committed his cause and
the combat to be tryed by the judgement of the King of England. After he had thus murdered his
brother, he tormented his wife to death by famine, who was daughter of the noble King of Boheme, lately
slaine in battayle by Geffery.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 7th of June 1380 another Ordeal by Battle was held. It is a very
singular story, and reads as if the guilty man were prevented from making a good
fight by the knowledge of his guilt. Fabyan and Stow both refer to the incident, but
only briefly; Holinshed is the authority for the fuller details. The accuser, Sir John
Annesley, charged Thomas Catrington, Esquire—Fabyan calls him Carton—with
having betrayed and sold to the French the castle of St. Sauveur in Normandy, of
which he was Governor. He brought the charge before the Court of the Constable
of England sitting at Westminster, concluding by throwing down his gauntlet and
offering to justify the words in open duel. Catrington denied the charge and
accepted the duel.</p>

<p>In the year 1384 another Ordeal of Battle took place in the Palace Lists,
which, like the last, resulted in the death of the unjust. The case was this:—One
Mortileto de Vilenos, a gentleman of Navarre, brought a charge of treason against
John Welsh, an English gentleman, stating that the treason had been committed
while Welsh was Governor of Cherbourg. They fought it out on St. Andrew’s Day,
the result being the overthrow of Mortileto, who then confessed that his charge was
without foundation, but that it was invented in revenge for the seduction of his wife
by Welsh. He was therefore by the King’s command hanged immediately, though
the Queen, Stow says, made earnest intercession to have his life saved.</p>

<p>Madox (<cite>Exchequer</cite>, i. 550) furnishes an account of an Ordeal by Battle with an
illustration of the manner of combat:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Now we are speaking of Duels, I will lay before the Reader a pretty remarkable Case of a Duel that
was fought in the Reign of K. Henry III. between Walter Bloweberme, an Approver, and Hamon le
Stere; together with a Draught or figure of the Duel, as it was drawn at that time. The Case was this.
Walter Bloweberme appealed Hamon le Stere of Robbery: alleging that they were together at Winchester,
and there stole Cloaths and other Goods; whereof Hamon had, for his Share, two Coats, to wit, one of
Irish Cloth, and the other a Party-coat or Cloth of Abendon and Burell of London: and that he (the said
Walter) was in Fellowship with the said Hamon in the said Robbery, he offereth to prove by his Body, as
the Court shall award. Hamon came and denyed the whole. And saith that he will defend himself by
his Body. Whereupon it was awarded, that there should be a Duel between them. A Duel was struck.
And Hamon being vanquished in the Combat, was adjudged to be hanged. It was found that Hamon
had no Chattels to forfeit to the King.”</p></blockquote>

have been fought out in Tothill Fields, Westminster, but ended very tamely, is
given at length in <cite>London in the Time of the Tudors</cite>, p. 391.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Collections of a London Citizen</cite> there are two Ordeals by Battle, one at
least, very grim and horrible:</p>

<small>SANCTUARY</small></h3>


<p>It is strange that an institution which played a large part in the social scheme of the
Middle Ages should have fallen so completely into decay as to be absolutely forgotten
by the people, so that there is not even a legend or a tradition of it left.
The memory of Sanctuary is as clean lost and forgotten as that of Frank Pledge.
Yet, three hundred years ago, the constant thought of debtor or malefactor was,
that, if the worst came to the worst, he could fly to St. Martin’s or to Westminster
and so escape the clink of Ludgate, or the gaol of Newgate. Even the murderer
always had it in mind when justice was in pursuit of him, that there was the refuge
of Sanctuary, if only he might win there, where he could be received, and could
abide in safety.</p>

<p>Like every other ecclesiastical foundation, the right of Sanctuary was originally
a beneficent and wise institution, designed by the Church for the protection of the
weak, and the prevention of revenge, wild justice, violence and oppression. If a
man, in those days of swift wrath and ready hand, should kill another in the
madness of a moment; if by accident he should wound or maim another; if by the
breaking of any law he should incur the penalties of justice; if by any action he
should incur the hostility of a stronger man; if by some of the many changes and
chances of fortune he should lose his worldly goods and fall into debt or bankruptcy,
and so become liable to imprisonment; if he had cause to dread the displeasure of
king, baron, or bishop, in all these cases the right of Sanctuary was open to him.
Once on the frith-stool, once clinging to the horns of the altar, he was as safe as an
Israelite within the walls of a City of Refuge: the mighty hand of the Church was
over him; his enemies could not touch him on pain of excommunication.</p>

<p>In theory every church was a sanctuary; but it was easy to blockade a church
so that the refugee could be starved into submission. If a felon took refuge in a
church, it was the duty of the neighbours to watch him, until he had either surrendered,
or, in presence of the proper officer, had abjured the realm. If he was
allowed to escape, the parish or the Ward was fined a hundred shillings, to be paid
to the King. The only real safety for a fugitive from justice or revenge was in
those abbeys and places which possessed special charters and immunities. Foremost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
among these were the Sanctuaries of Westminster and St. Martin’s-le-Grand. Outside
London, the principal sanctuaries appear to have been Beverley, Hexham,
Durham, and Beaulieu. But every abbey, like every church, possessed its sanctuary
as a part of its privileges. That of Westminster was, if not founded, defined and
regulated by Edward the Confessor; that of St. Martin’s, the existence of which
was always a scandal and an offence to the City of London, was regulated by half
a dozen charters of as many kings. Its refugees were
principally bankrupts, debtors, and common thieves; these
as offenders against property were especially hated by a
trading community.</p>

<p>The privilege of sanctuary was beautiful in theory.
“Come to me,” said the Church, “I will keep thee in safety
from the hand of violence and the arm of the law; I will
give thee lodging and food; my doors shall be always open
to thee, day and night; I will lead thee to repentance.
Come, and in safety sit down and meditate on the sins
which brought thee hither.”</p>

<div class="caption">SANCTUARY KNOCKER,<br />DURHAM
CATHEDRAL</div>
</div>

<p>The invitation was extended to all, but with certain
reservations. Nor was it merely a formal invitation; sanctuary was actually
sought by multitudes, but traitors, Jews, infidels, and those who had committed
sacrilege, were not received. In Durham Cathedral two men slept
every night in the Galilee Chapel to admit any fugitive who might ring
the bell or lift the knocker. Nay, sanctuary was actually converted into a
city of refuge by the setting apart of a measured space, the whole of which
was to be considered sanctuary. At Hexham, where four roads met in the
middle of the town, a cross was set up on every one of the roads to show where
sanctuary began. At Ripon and at Beverley a circle with a radius of a mile was
the limit of sanctuary. At St. Martin’s-le-Grand the precinct was accurately laid
down, and jealously defended. It included many streets, and the area is now almost
entirely covered by the buildings of the General Post Office. At Westminster the
whole precinct of the Abbey, church, monastery buildings, close, cloisters, and
gardens were sacred ground.</p>

<p>In <cite>Archæologia</cite> (xvii. p. 198) is given the oath of sanctuary. I extract the
whole passage:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Among the Harleian Manuscripts in the British Museum is a thin folio volume written upon vellum
marked No. 4292, and containing the Register of Persons who sought sanctuary for different crimes at
St. John of Beverley in Yorkshire, in the reigns of King Edward the Fourth, King Henry the Seventh,
and King Henry the Eighth. The bookbinder, by whom it appears to have been rebound of later years,
seems to have mixed some of the leaves, or, at least, to have put the entries of King Edward the Fourth’s
time after some of those of King Henry the Seventh’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>The greater part of the manuscript is of course confined to a list of names and crimes; but on the
reverse of folio 17 is a copy of the oath taken by those who sought the peace of the place. I do not
remember to have met with a sanctuary oath elsewhere. The bailiff of the town, by whom the oath was
administered, is directed to inquire of the refugee ‘what man he killed, and wher with, and both ther
names: and than gar hym lay his hand uppon the book, sayng on this wyse.</p>

<p>The history of St. Martin’s-le-Grand is the history of a stalwart resistance and
defence of the rights of sanctuary against the attacks of the citizens and others. For
in a lawless age no rights, no privileges, no laws are obeyed. In Wat Tyler’s
rebellion his followers paid no respect to sanctuary; they dragged from the very
altars the tax-collectors who had hurried thither to be out of danger. Twenty years
later the City itself protested against the abuses caused by the immunities of the
sanctuary. But as yet the place was too strongly fortified by charters and papal
bulls for any change to be effected. The King, on the other hand, took the line
that it was by the negligence of the City magistrates that so many crimes were
committed, and that so many claimants of sanctuary existed.</p>

<p>There is a story of sanctuary at St. Paul’s told by Riley (<cite>Mem.</cite> p. 24). It was
in the 17th year of King Edward the First, and on the Day of St. George, that
one Walter Bacon, a chaplain, or Parish Priest, took sanctuary in the Cathedral.
Thither came, in consequence, the King’s Coroner, William le Mazeliner, the warden
of the City (it was during the suspension of the Mayor’s office), John le Breton, Sir
Baroncin, John de Banquelle, and other trustworthy persons. Then the Coroner,
in the presence of the assembled company, demanded of the man for what reason he
had taken sanctuary. Whereupon the man replied that it was because he had
stolen sixteen silver dishes belonging to Sir Baroncin. The dishes being restored,
the Sheriff was instructed to take charge of them in a sealed packet; and two days
after the packet was opened by the Sheriff in presence of the Coroner, and the dishes
were given back to the said Baroncin. What became of the chaplain is not stated.</p>

<p>Many examples have been preserved of those who sought safety within those
walls. There is the case of one Henry who stole a signet ring, a pyx for consecrated
wafers; had it ever been used he would have been debarred sanctuary for
sacrilege; he also stole some money and other things. He took sanctuary, then
he changed his mind and fled, leaving his stolen property behind him. The Dean’s
officers seized it as a “waif” left within the soke or franchise of the College. There
is, again, the case of Henry Ciprian, Canon of Waltham. He, for certain offences,
took refuge at St. Martin’s. It was in the year 1430, the 9th of King Henry the
Sixth. The Mayor and Sheriffs thereupon seized him and dragged him out. The
Dean and Canons brought the case before the King, who ordered Ciprian to be
restored to sanctuary. But the smouldering hostility of the City continued and
increased. The Alderman of Aldersgate, Matthew Philip, on the imposition of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
certain tax, called upon the Dean of St. Martin’s for his share, alleging that it was
not a privileged place; and actually levied the money by distress. The King
ordered it to be restored.</p>

<p>In the same year occurred the famous case of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, which,
though it was decided against the City, strengthened enormously the case against
sanctuary.</p>

<p>A certain soldier named Knight lay in prison at Newgate. His friends
trumped up a case of debt against him, to answer to which he had to be taken
to the Guildhall; therefore he passed the south side of St. Martin’s. Five of
his friends lay in ambush in Panyer Alley, and as he passed they dragged him
from the officers, and so into sanctuary, where they all remained. Surely this
was an abuse of the privilege. The City thought so, evidently. The Sheriffs,
Philip Malpas and Robert Marshall, with the Alderman of the Ward, the City
Chamberlain, and a great multitude of people, crowded into St. Martin’s demanding
the prisoners, whom the Canon refused to surrender. They therefore seized them
by force, chained and manacled them, stripped them to their shirts, and led them off
to Newgate. Evidently it was a case which excited the greatest indignation. The
King, on receiving the complaint of the Dean, ordered the release of the prisoners
by letters taken from Windsor to the Tower by Lord Huntingdon. The Mayor
refused to open the letters. He said that the Tower was a privileged place outside
his jurisdiction, and that he could perform no official act in it, not even the opening
of a letter addressed to himself as Mayor. Lord Huntingdon then produced the
King’s writ, which was received and considered in the Church of Allhallows Barking.
Here, with the assistance of the City clerk, John Carpenter, they found some legal
objection, which they conveyed to the King.</p>

<p>The matter, however, was heard in the Star Chamber. The case of the Dean
was based, of course, on the Charters of the House, and on the antiquity of the
privileges claimed. The case of the Sheriffs, where it did not depend upon a legal
quibble, rested on the enormous inconvenience and the many mischiefs caused by
the sanctuary. Thus one Stody deliberately murdered a woman, took refuge in the
sanctuary, and succeeded in escaping; John Frowe, having a grudge against one
Robert Dodmerton, dogged him till he was close to the gate of sanctuary, where he
stabbed him in the neck, so that he died, when the murderer calmly took refuge in
the sanctuary. One Lullay, a Cambridge man, did exactly the same thing in the
same place. It was also argued that certain criminals in the reign of Henry the
Fifth had been taken from sanctuary, that a lane of the precinct in which criminals
assembled had been stopped by order of the King, and that church, precinct, and
lane were all portions of the City itself. These arguments prevailed not. The
Sheriffs had to give up the prisoners.</p>

<p>Another mischief caused by this privilege was the fabrication of counterfeit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
plate and jewels which was established there. The Goldsmiths’ Company, who had
the right to examine all goldsmiths’ shops in the City, demanded admission to St.
Martin’s Precinct in order to examine the workshops there. The Dean refused permission
as a right, but invited them to come in and inspect the work. He himself
went with them, and caused all bad work to be destroyed. Edward the Fourth, in
a statute against fraudulent goldsmiths’ work, excepted the Precinct from its
operation. It is interesting to note that makers of counterfeit plate and jewels
continued in their old quarters long after the Dissolution. Thus Butler says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“’Tis not those paltry counterfeits</div>
   <div class="verse">French stones which in our eyes you set,</div>
   <div class="verse">But our right diamonds that inspire,</div>
   <div class="verse">And set your am’rous hearts on fire.</div>
   <div class="verse">Nor can those false St. Martin’s beads,</div>
   <div class="verse">Which on our lips you place for reds,</div>
   <div class="verse">And make us wear like Indian dames,</div>
   <div class="verse">All fuel to your scorching flames,</div>
   <div class="verse">But those, true rubies of the rock</div>
   <div class="verse">Which in the cabinets we lock.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Perhaps the strength of St. Martin’s was best shown in the case of William Cayens.
He was one of Jack Cade’s associates, and on the dispersion of the rebels he took
sanctuary in St. Martin’s. The King demanded him as a traitor. The Dean took
with him all his bulls and charters and pleaded the case. In the end he won it.
The traitor was to remain, but to be prevented from committing any more treason.
Some time after, Cayens received the King’s pardon, and was even admitted to his
favour.</p>

<p>When the Civil Wars broke out one Oldehall, chamberlain to the Duke of York,
was ordered by the King’s advisers not to leave the City of London. He fled to
sanctuary, was dragged out, and was ordered to be taken back again. Up to this
point the Dean had proved too strong for the City. But in the year 1455 the
sanctuary men presumed so much upon their security that they formed into companies
and attacked and robbed the citizens. Thereupon the Mayor and Sheriffs
broke into Sanctuary and seized the ringleaders. The Dean complained, the King
sent for the Mayor and his officers, but the time was not one in which the City
could be made hostile, and the prisoners were not restored.</p>

<p>Again, in the year following, the sanctuary men took part in an attack upon
the Italian merchants. The complaints were now so general and so loud that
some restriction had to be imposed on the privilege. Articles were drawn up for
the better regulation of the Sanctuary. They are like those already quoted from
the Archives of Beverley. Thus (1) every person on entering must declare the
cause of his seeking refuge. (2) No one is to carry any weapon within the Precinct.
(3) That any “erraunt and open thiefe, robber, murderer and felon noised by the
common fame of the people” shall find security for good behaviour both in sanctuary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and for a quarter of a year afterwards, and that he be kept in ward until he has
found that security. But he may depart if he pleases. (4) The gates to be shut at
certain hours. (5) Stolen goods not to be taken into sanctuary. (6) If any acts
of robbery or violence be committed by a sanctuary man he is to be placed in prison
and kept there. But he may depart if he will (of course to find the Sheriff’s officer
waiting for him). (7) Forgers, makers of counterfeit goods, pickers of locks, etc.,
not to be allowed in sanctuary, (8) Strumpets and all immoral persons to be kept
in prison until they amend or depart. (9) Gambling—“plays at hazard, the dice,
the guell, the kayelles, the cloysh”—to be forbidden in sanctuary. (10) Sundays
and holy days to be kept, and (11) every person admitted to take oath that he will
obey these rules.</p>

<p>Already, on more than one occasion, the difference between mediæval laws and
mediæval practice has been remarked. What, for instance, could be better than
these ordinances? Everything seems to be provided for, merciful refuge for the
criminal, prison for those who commit new crimes, the practice of dishonest trades
forbidden, the morality of the sanctuary protected, the place to be a House of
Religion and Repentance, and not a refuge and lurking place for thieves and rogues.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
What happened? That the sanctuary went on just as before. There was, no
doubt, some little stir at the outset: the Canons ordered their servants to exercise
diligence in the maintenance of these laws: we have seen the Dean going round
with the Goldsmiths’ officer; perhaps he went round with his own officers, and
questioned the refugees, admonished them all, both men and women, and then
departed. The decay of all the Monastic and Ecclesiastical foundations was
everywhere partly due to the fact that, while the Rule remained, that part of it
which demanded personal service was handed over to servants and inferior officers.
The criminal who ran into the sanctuary was received by a servant, not by the
Canons: he was lodged by a servant, not by the Canons; then, the food provided
being humble in quality and insufficient in quantity, the refugee carried on his trade
in order to get more food; probably the custom grew up, as it had grown up in the
prisons of Newgate and Ludgate, of paying fees to the sanctuary officers; in return
for those fees everything was permitted. Men, who lived by robbery and who were
well known to be robbers; women who lived by procuring and by prostitution;
sharpers, forgers, fabricators of false goods, fraudulent bankrupts, receivers of
stolen goods; thieves actually took sanctuary with their stolen goods in their
hands; all these people lived in security and peace: they escaped the pillory, the
stocks, the agony of the whipping-post, the noisome prison, and the gallows.
The City did well to protest without ceasing against the abuse of the Sanctuary.</p>

<p>During the civil wars St. Martin’s proved a veritable Haven of Refuge to
many, including the Countess of Oxford, Morton, Bishop of Ely, and other prelates,
as well as both Lords and Ladies. In St. Martin’s lived and died—“rotted away
piecemeal”—Miles Forrest, one of the murderers of the young Princes. A great
change was made in St. Martin’s when the College was transferred by Henry the
Seventh to the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster. The Abbot became Dean of
St. Martin’s; another seal was made; the duties of the Canons were performed
by Vicars.</p>

<p>In the year 1548 all chantries, free chapels, and brotherhoods were suppressed,
St. Martin’s among them. The splendid church was pulled down; the site was
speedily built over by tenements and shops and taverns. But superstition and
custom reserved until a much later time some of the privileges of sanctuary both at
St. Martin’s and at Westminster.</p>

<p>The Chronicle of the west end sanctuary is somewhat nobler.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the whole Precinct of the Abbey and not the
Church only was the sanctuary, of which the more sacred part, of course, was the
Church. But the name of sanctuary was especially given to a gloomy square
pile built of ragstone, about seventy-five feet square and about sixty feet high.
Outside was a round tower no higher than the building itself, which contained a
stair communicating with the upper storey. There were two storeys, each of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
was a chapel, the lower one being especially dark and gloomy. On the roof it
appears there were sometimes erected small houses for the accommodation of
refugees.</p>

<p>By a very remarkable omission, this interesting building is not noticed by Stow
or by any later writer. Stukeley first observed it, and sketched and measured it in
the year 1750 when they were taking it down.</p>

<p>Here is a glimpse (1556) of a sanctuary procession:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The vi. day of December the Abbot of Westminster went a procession with his convent: before
him went all the sanctuary men with crosse keys [upon their garments] and after went iij. for murder: one,
the Lord Dacre’s sone, of the Northe, was wypyd (whipped) with a shett abowt him for kyllyng of a man,
master West sqwyre dwellyng besyd ... and anodur theyff that dyd long to one of master comtroller ...
dyd kyll Recherd Eggyllston the comtroller’s tayller, and [killed him in] the Long Acurs, the bak-syd
Charyng-crosse: and a boye [that] kyld a byge boye that sold papers and pryntyd bokes [with] horlyng of
a stone and yt hym under the ere in Westmynster Hall: the boy was one of the chylderyn what was [at
the] sckoll ther in the abbey: the boy was a hossear sune [hosier’s son] a-boyff London-stone.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption">THE SANCTUARY CHURCH AT WESTMINSTER<br />
From Allen’s <cite>History of London</cite>.</div>
</div>

<p>The whipping of Lord Dacre’s son, wrapped in a white sheet, for murder, must
have been edifying. Sanctuary, therefore, was not wholly free from pains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
penalties. Two months later, another man in sanctuary was whipped “before the
cross” for murder.</p>

<p>Not always, however, were the rights of sanctuary respected. That Wat
Tyler should respect them was hardly to be expected. Therefore we read without
surprise how he dragged the Marshal of the Marshalsea from one of the pillars of
the Confessor’s shrine, to which, as the holiest place in the church, he was clinging.
But the murder of the knight Hawke in the year 1398 is a very remarkable
illustration of the violence and ungovernable temper into which the men of that time
could fall. There were two knights named Hawke and Shackle. In the Spanish
wars of the Black Prince they had between them effected the valuable capture of a
Spanish noble. He exchanged his son, a youth, for himself, a method of hostage
not uncommon, and went home, leaving the two Englishmen expectant of a lordly
ransom. Then, however, John of Gaunt, who claimed the throne of Spain, demanded
the delivery of the young Spaniard to himself. This was refused. Thereupon he
threatened imprisonment, so that the knights fled and took sanctuary at Westminster,
accompanied by the captive disguised as a page or valet. It would seem as if they
were pursued on their flight. At least what follows does not look like a deed done
in cold blood. The two knights fled into the church as the safest part of the
sanctuary. Thither they were followed by Alan Bloxhall, Constable of the Tower,
Sir Ralph Ferrers, and a company of fifty men. Shackle, for his part, escaped with
the page—probably into the cloisters, where he could easily be conveyed to a place
of safety. But Hawke remained in the church and ran round the choir followed by
his enemies. This took place actually during the celebration of High Mass. At
last the wretched man fell covered with wounds in front of the Prior’s stall, that is,
within the choir. After this, the Prior closed the church for four months, and
caused the violators of the sanctuary to be excommunicated, as well as fining them
£200 apiece—equal to nearly £3000 of our money. If sanctuary, if sacrilege meant
anything at all, the abbot was bound to make as much as he could of the “factum
horribile.” The unfortunate Hawke was buried in the south transept.</p>

<p>But there were other violations of sanctuary, as when Sir Robert Tresilian,
Lord Chief Justice, was dragged out from the refuge he had sought; and when the
Duke of Exeter was treated likewise: on the other hand, Henry the Seventh
showed his wisdom in respecting sanctuary when Perkin Warbeck took shelter
there.</p>

<p>And sanctuary was, as a rule, respected. When Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of
Gloucester, went into sanctuary at Westminster, she was unmolested, and might
have stayed there all her life had she chosen. Elizabeth Woodville gave birth to
her elder boy, “forsaken by her friends and in great penury,” yet in safe keeping.
Here she placed the child in his father’s arms on his return. A second time she
fled thither when that boy, thirteen years of age, was in the hands of her enemy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
in the Tower. She took with her the younger boy, but we all know what happened.
Sanctuary was broken. The Archbishops gave their consent to the sacrilege even
though they knew, everybody must have known, that the boys would be murdered
one after the other. It was the lot of every prince or possible heir to the throne in
those times to be murdered or to be slain in battle. Henry the Sixth, Prince
Edward, the Duke of York, the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Exeter, are all
examples instructive enough. Yet the Archbishops yielded. Why? I think it is
clear that they dreaded above all things a boy King: above all things they wanted
repose for the distracted land. It was a case of choosing between the lives of two
innocent boys, or fresh wars, new distractions, which? The violation of sanctuary
in this case is remarkable for the opportunity it gave the Duke of Buckingham to
attack the whole system of sanctuary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I dare well avow it, weigh the good that they do with the hurt that cometh of them, and ye shall
find it much better to lack both than to have both. And this I say, although they were not abused as
they now be, and so long have been, that I fear me they will ever be, while men be afraid to set their
hands to the amendment: as though God and St. Peter were the patrons of ungracious living. Now
unthrifts riot and run in debt upon the boldness of these places: yea, and rich men run thither with poor
men’s goods. There they build, there they spend and bid their creditors go whistle for them. Men’s
wives run thither with their husbands’ plate, and say they dare not abide with their husbands for beating.
Thieves bring thither their stolen goods, and there live thereon. There devise they new robberies
nightly to steal out, they rob, and reave, and kill, and come in again as though those places gave them not
only a safeguard for the harm they have done, but a licence also to do more mischief.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It must not be forgotten that Skelton the poet escaped the wrath of Wolsey
by taking refuge in the Westminster Sanctuary, where he lived in safety and died
unmolested.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Italian Relations of England</cite> (Camden Society), probably written at
the end of the fifteenth century, the author bears testimony of the same kind to the
evils of sanctuary. Apparently the institution did not exist in Italy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The clergy are they who have the supreme sway over the country, both in peace and war.
Amongst other things, they have provided that a number of sacred places in the kingdom should serve for
the refuge and escape of all delinquents: and no one, were he a traitor to the crown, or had he practised
against the king’s own person, can be taken out of these by force. And a villain of this kind, who, for
some great excess that he has committed, has been obliged to take refuge in one of these sacred places,
often goes out of it to brawl in the public streets, and then, returning to it, escapes with impunity for
every fresh offence he may have been guilty of. This is no detriment to the purses of the priests, nor to
the other perpetual sanctuaries: but every church is a sanctuary for 40 days: and, if a thief or a murderer
who has taken refuge in one cannot leave it in safety during these 40 days, he gives notice that he wishes
to leave England. In which case, being stripped to the shirt by the chief magistrate of the place, and a
crucifix placed in his hand, he is conducted along the road to the sea, where, if he finds a passage, he may
go with a ‘God speed you!’ But if he should not find one, he walks into the sea up to the throat, and
three times asks for a passage: and this is repeated till a ship appears, which comes for him, and so
he departs in safety. It is not unamusing to hear, how the women and children lament over the
misfortune of these exiles, asking ‘how they can live so destitute out of England’: adding, moreover, that
‘they had better have died than go out of the world,’ as if England were the whole world!”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>Henry the Seventh in 1483 procured a bull from Pope Innocent the Eighth,
which allowed of malefactors being taken out of sanctuary when it was proved that
they had left sanctuary in order to commit some mischief. And that if persons
suspected of high treason took refuge it should be permitted to the King to station
guards at the gates and elsewhere to keep them from going out. Later, in the year
1504, Henry the Seventh procured another bull permitting him to take out persons
suspected of high treason. This bull would seem to allow the actual destruction of
sanctuary.</p>

<p>The procedure in the claim of sanctuary was as follows (the statute being
put up in the Custom Hall of the Cinque Ports, Dover), (<cite>Italian Relations</cite>):—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And when any shall flee into the church or churchyard for felony, claiming thereof the privilege for
any action of his life, the head officer of the same liberty where the said church or churchyard is, with his
fellow jurats or commoners of the same liberty, shall come to him and shall ask him the cause of being
there, and if he will not confess felony immediately, it shall be entered in record, and his goods and
chattels shall be forfeited, and he shall tarry there forty days, or before, if he will, he shall make his
abjuration in form following before the head officer, who shall assign to him the port of his passage: and
after his abjuration there shall be delivered unto him by the head officer, or his assignees, a cross, and
proclamation shall be made that while he be going by the highway towards the port to him assigned, he
shall go in the king’s peace, and that no man shall grieve him in so doing, on pain to forfeit his goods and
chattels. And the said felon shall lay his right hand on the book, and swear this:—‘You hear, Mr.
Coroner, that I ... a thief, have stolen such a thing, or have killed such a woman, or man, or a child,
and am the king’s felon, and for that I have done many evil deeds and felonys in this same his land, I do
abjure and forswear the lands of the kings of England, and that I shall haste myself to the port of ...
which you have given or assigned me: and that I shall not go out of the highway, and if I do, I will that
I shall be taken as a thief, and the king’s felon, and at the same place I shall tarry but one ebb and flood,
if I may have passage: and if I cannot have passage in the same place, I shall go every day into the sea to
my knees and above, crying, Passage, for the love of God, and King ... his sake: and if I may not
within forty days together, I shall get me again into the church, as the king’s felon. So help me God and
by this book according to your judgment.’ And if a clerk flying to the church for felony, affirming
himself to be a clerk, he shall not abjure the realm, but yielding himself to the laws of the realm, shall
enjoy the liberties of the church, and shall be delivered to the ordinary, to be kept safe to the convict
prison, according to the laudable custom of the realm of England.”</p></blockquote>

<small>MIRACLE AND MYSTERY PLAYS</small></h3>


<p>I have elsewhere spoken of the singular fact that no remains of a Roman
theatre or amphitheatre have been found in London, and I have ventured to put
forward a theory as to the site of one or both. One cannot, indeed, understand
how there could be a theatre at Rutupiæ, or at Bath, and none at London. It is
true that Augusta was, for the greater part of her Roman existence, a Christian
City; but so was Bath; it is also true that the Church condemned the Theatre.
But these facts did not destroy the Theatre. St. Augustine tells us how much
he was attracted by the drama—<i lang="la">rapiunt me spectacula theatrica</i>. The total
destruction of the Roman theatre in the country with the stage machinery and
the stage traditions, we may be quite sure, was effected, not by the thunders of
the Church, but by the coming of the Angles and the Saxons, and by the Desolation
of Augusta. The drama had to begin again later on. As the mimetic instinct
always survives every attempt at repression, the drama in some form was sure to
revive. It began again in two forms: first, in the Church, the very place whence
it had been denounced, and in the entertainments given by wandering mummers,
minstrels, dancers, and tumblers. The wandering folk, the show folk, the <i lang="fr">ribauds</i>,
the people who cannot work, the men and women who can only earn their bread
by making music and merriment, by telling stories, singing songs, performing
tricks, dancing, turning somersaults, and pandering to the ever-present desire for
pleasure,—these people cannot be suppressed; and they kept alive the art of acting.
In England they flourished exceedingly in quiet times. What sort of rude play
they performed it is not possible to ascertain. It was, I believe, a rough and ready
farce, like that preserved in Rabelais, where the Farce of the Dumb Woman is
presented. The people want to laugh. What do they mostly laugh at? The
discomfiture of some one in some way. Enter the Dumb Woman—she makes
great business with her broom; she knocks down one man with it and hits another
over the nose; both men complain and suffer pain and indignity. Then the
people laugh. Add music and a tumbling girl; add gestures unseemly and jokes
unfit for repetition. Add, further, anything you please from the modern role of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
clown and pantaloon, and we shall understand the entertainment afforded by the
show folk of the eleventh century. I suppose that they sometimes made fun of the
priests—always a tempting subject—one reason for thinking so is that the more
reverend a man wishes to be thought, the more he lays himself open to ridicule;
another reason is that contemporary writers, as John of Salisbury, condemn
actors with ecclesiastical plainness. They were in request, it would appear, at
marriage feasts, and the nature of their entertainment is indicated by the order
that any priests who were present were to get up and go away when the players
began. These people have left little behind them, but they maintained the taste
for scenic performances, and, no doubt, they drew away from the plough or the
carpenter’s bench many a lad whose heart yearned for the music and the twinkling
feet, the bright dresses, and the laughing life of these masterless vagabonds and
lawless girls. But in England nothing was written or invented: it is to the Church
and not to the show folk that we owe the modern drama. And it began with the
laudable desire—nay, the necessity—of making people, in whom the imagination
was dull, realise the doctrines of the Church. The service was in Latin, a language
not comprehended any longer even in Italy; nobody could read; there were no
books for them if they could: preaching, of which there was little before the
Friars came, could not effect much: mural painting was not even begun: how then
were the people to be taught the leading events, the foundations, in the History
of the Christian Faith? Only by some kind of dramatic representation. Thus,
at Christmas-time it was easy—nay, praiseworthy—to build a stall for oxen in the
church; to fit it with a manger; to invite all the people to see for themselves, as
if they were alive, the Virgin Mother with the Infant Christ, Joseph, the Magi,
the angels, and the shepherds. On Good Friday a great crucifix was set up and
solemnly lowered into the grave. On Easter Day the stone of the sepulchre was
rolled away and our Lord came forth; after Easter He walked with the pilgrims
of Emmaus; He appeared to the disciples. At Ascension He mounted visibly to
Heaven in the sight of all. So also, He raised Lazarus; He healed the sick;
He washed the feet. When the simple people looked on and saw such miracles
who could doubt? Nay, who could ever forget? “There is the grave, with
Lazarus in it—look at him! The grave-clothes are swathed about him, his face is
white, he is dead, there is even to another sense the unmistakable proof of death.
Here comes the Lord Himself. Tell me not that it is Brother Ambrose—it is
the Lord Himself! Who but the Lord can bring a dead man to life? It is the
Very Christ!” So they went away marvelling. These things were elementary;
but they offered scope for acting, and they offered food for the imagination. Of
course they became more and more realistic. The priests’ robes were exchanged
for suitable dresses; the chorister, who represented an angel, added wings to his
white surplice, and carried a harp and wore a crown. And the field of the drama<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
widened. It included at length the whole scheme of Redemption from the Fall
of Lucifer to the Day of Judgment.</p>

<div class="caption">NORTH-WEST VIEW OF THE RUINS OF THE BISHOP OF WINCHESTER’S PALACE, SOUTHWARK</div>
</div>

<p>The procession of the Patron Saint, or any other holy day, and that of Corpus
Christi Day were further used to teach the people in the dramatic way. The saints
marched with the Trade Guilds; they were known by what they carried. Adam
and Eve wore the Tree of Knowledge; John the Baptist was a herald—everybody
at that time knew what was meant by a herald; Judas followed. Of course he
was received with hisses and groans, but he could not escape observation, because
he carried a bag of gold and was followed by the Devil with the gallows;
Christopher carried Christ; the wise men carried gifts; nothing was forgotten.
That these representations sank deeply into the hearts of the people is certain,
because it is only natural that this should be their effect. A story is related of
a German Prince, the Landgrave Frederic of the Scarred Cheek, who, after
witnessing a play of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, in which the Virgin Mary herself
failed to move her Son to mercy, cried out, “What sort of thing is Christian faith
if Christians cannot be pardoned even on the intercession of the mother of God
and all the Saints?” And so fell into a religious melancholy such as was common
in later times among Calvinists. But it wants no such story to make us understand
the power of these dramatic performances. At first they were presented in dumb
show; then with the words of the Bible; lastly, with words specially written for
them. The next step was the transfer of the stage from the nave of the church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
to the place outside. This took place when the machinery required was too large
for the little parish church, and when the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> were too numerous for
the ecclesiastical staff of the Church. Then the laity became the actors, speedily
the only actors. At the same time, the Church did not surrender control over
the plays: in Rome there was the Fraternity of the Gonfaler: in Antwerp the
Brethren of St. Luke, who were authorised to perform these plays. In England
they were divided among the Trade Guilds, every one of which had to exhibit
some dramatic scene on the Feast of Corpus Christi. Thus at Coventry the smiths
played the Trial and Crucifixion; the Cappers played the Resurrection and Descent
into Hell; the Shearmen played the Birth of Christ, the Adoration of the Magi,
the Flight into Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents. In London the
Company of Parish Clerks took a prominent part, one of their performances being
recorded by Stow as lasting for three days. This was at the Skinners’ Well,
Smithfield, in the year 1391. Another performance is also mentioned which took
place in 1409, and lasted for eight days. The civic procession of Corpus Christi,
which was attended by Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen, with all the City officers,
together with the City clergy, and was adorned by pageants and figures and groups,
was entrusted to the Skinners’ Company. I have not been able to discover other
London companies entrusted with the representation of these plays. The stage
was of considerable area, and contained two “rooms,” the upper room for heaven
and the lower for earth; or the upper “room” was earth and the lower was hell.
Sometimes there were three “rooms.” The play was introduced by a prologue:
each player was presented by name: when not acting the players stood aside and
were supposed to be invisible. The realism was startling. When Judas was
hanged he carried to the gallows the entrails of some animal, which, when he cast
himself off, he let fall. At the same time the devil, who was behind him on the
gallows, cut the rope, and they both fell down into hell together. There was no
shrinking from the representation of a birth upon the stage: saints in torture made
jokes; Solomon quarrelled with one of his wives and drank a mug of beer; the
devil carried off a soul in a wheelbarrow; at the scene of the Resurrection the
gardener made fun over the effects of his herbs; the pedlar wanted to sell his wares
to the women weeping over the grave; the mouth of hell vomited flames; Adam
and Eve appeared as they were before the Fall; it is as if the Church wanted to
make the event more real by connecting it with the actual life, the unmistakable
life of men and women. From Church to Market-place was one step; from the
mystery to the morality is another step; the last step of all was from the morality,
an insipid performance, to the real comedy of human life, and even this had to
make its way by means of the drama founded on the life of the saint. How great
a step to discover that in every man there was a possible drama equal in interest
to the life of any saint or martyr! There is very little positive information about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the early drama in London. Yet we know that the miracle play was performed
here as well as elsewhere. Stow’s contribution to our knowledge I have already
quoted. FitzStephen, too, speaks of these plays. Piers Plowman mentions them
as common. Chaucer’s Wife of Bath goes to processions, pilgrimages, miracle
plays, and marriages. To the class of Church Play belongs the curious function
of the Boy Bishop, which was practised in St. Paul’s and in many parish churches
of the City. On the eve of St. Nicholas, the choristers elected one of their number
to be the Boy Bishop. A set of episcopal robes was provided for the boy, including
a mitre, a pastoral staff, and all the vestments:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Towards the end of evensong on St. John’s Day, the boy bishop and his clerks, arrayed in their
copes and having burning tapers in their hands, and singing those words of the Apocalypse (ch. xiv.),
<i lang="la">Centum quadraginta</i>, walked processionally from the Choir to the Altar of the Blessed Trinity, which the
boy bishop incensed. Afterwards they all sang the anthem, and he recited the prayer commemorative of
the Holy Innocents. Going back into the Choir, these boys took possession of the upper Canons’ stalls,
and those dignitaries themselves had to serve in the boys’ places, and carry the candles, the thurible, the
book, like acolytes, thurisers, and lower clerks. Standing on high, wearing his mitre, and holding his
pastoral staff in his left hand, the boy bishop gave his solemn benediction to all present; and, while
making the sign of the cross over the kneeling crowd, he said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Crucis signo vos consigno: vestra sit tuitio.</div>
   <div class="verse">Quos nos emit et redemit suæ carnis pretio.”</div>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>The day after, a sermon, which was written for him, was preached by the Boy
Bishop; at this the scholars of St. Paul’s were bound to attend. It has been
sometimes stated that the boy celebrated mass, but this is not true; it was
impossible at any time in the history of the Church that a child or any person but a
priest should be allowed to celebrate mass.</p>

<p>This curious and apparently irreverent ceremony formed part of the general
rejoicing, mumming, and feasting of the season. Probably it was explained in
something of this way. It taught the children that the things done by the altar
concerned them, the young as well as the old. It deepened their impression and
strengthened their hold of the simple doctrines which they were taught. It was, in
other words, a presentment of the same thing in a different form.</p>

<small>SUPERSTITIONS, ETC.</small></h3>


<p>When we think of the great mass of people of Mediæval London, when we
think of their laborious and industrious days, the precarious nature of their lives,
the perils which attended them, far greater to our thinking than those of the present
day—dangers ever present, of fire, famine, plague, pestilence, and war, we are moved
to inquire into the ideas and beliefs which controlled the minds of this apparently
inarticulate mass. There were ideas on religion, on superstitions, on manners and
customs, on war, and on government. As regards their religion, there was no
doubt, or question, or hesitation whatever, as to the one leading doctrine which
influenced them. They were all, of course, absolutely certain that after death came
either the pains of purgatory or the torments of hell. How could there be either
doubt or question, when they could see depicted on the walls of the churches the
Day of Judgment with the devils receiving souls and hurling them into the flames?
They could see the souls themselves plunged to the neck in yellow flames, in
torments unspeakable and endless, with bodies unconsumed and indestructible: the
golden Heavens, the saints sitting with crowns upon their heads and harps in their
hands. On these points there could be no doubt. Since every man, as the priests
told them, was continually committing all kinds of sin, both carnal and venial, there
was no chance for any one to escape except through the pains of purgatory. These,
of course, could be procured as a substitute for the other place by the kind offices of
the Church. For this reason, and among the great mass of the people for no other
reason, not because the Church cultivated morality and honesty, peace and mercy
and righteousness, but simply and solely in order to secure purgatory which, at least,
however terrible, did offer a termination after many years: with this object in view,
and with no other, the rich men built their churches, founded chantries, masses,
almshouses, paid pilgrimages, gave rich presents to the Church, and built colleges
for the priests.</p>

<p>At first a man was sufficiently fortified by the last offices ordered by the
Church itself: he died in hope when he had received extreme unction. Presently,
however, people became a little doubtful; the fear arose that the service of the
Church for the dying might prove by itself insufficient to ensure for the soul entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
into purgatory. Accordingly, therefore, new precautions were invented. Men
thought that it would be safer for them if they were buried in consecrated ground
within, not outside, the walls of the church: again, it would certainly be safer to be
laid as near the high altar as possible. Then again, it was discovered that the
church of the monastery was more sacred, and therefore still safer than the parish
church. After this, it was believed that some monasteries were even safer than
others. Thus the Greyfriars Church in London was esteemed a much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
desirable place of interment than St. Paul’s: it was therefore crammed from east to
west with monuments of kings and princes, great lords and great ladies. Here they
all lay buried in the habit of a Franciscan, hoping either to step into Heaven in
the guise of a Friar, or at least, being in such a guise, to get off at the Last Day
with a shorter allowance of purgatory than that due to them, or even without any
purgatory at all.</p>

<p>It seems to us, with our ideas of equality, a most monstrous belief that a rich
man should be able to buy himself out of purgatory, while a poor man must endure
the full weight and penalty of his sins. I do not think that the poor man considered
the matter in this way at all. On the contrary, it was one of the attributes of
wealth and rank that they should make the conquest of Heaven more easy. The
poor accepted the situation. Their poverty was imposed upon them with all its
consequences. They could not, however they tried, rise out of it: between
nobility and villeinhood there was an impassable gulf: well for them that the Lord
had left open a way even after many thousand years of purgatory.</p>

<p>As regards the doctrines of the Church, the great mass of the people knew very
little, and questioned not at all. The history of the Saints and of the Old and New
Testaments they partially understood, because on the walls and in the windows of
their parish churches were everywhere represented the acts of Christ and of the
Apostles and those of the Saints. Moreover, as we have seen, in the mysteries or
sacred plays, the scenes from the Old Testament were performed with grotesque,
and even burlesque, imitations in the open air for all the world to see.</p>

<p>The influence of the Church on morals was probably no greater in the Middle
Ages than it is now. Certainly men were no more moral than they are now.
In saying this, one is not attacking the moral influence of the Church. In
a time of greater rudeness, greater ignorance, greater lack of self-command,
greater violence, one would expect what actually happened, viz. that there
were times when the power of the Church seemed lost, <i>e.g.</i> in the Civil Wars
of King Stephen’s reign. As for the City, much the same cheating went on in
trade, and there was quite as much laxity in morals of every other kind as we can
boast of in our own time. Moreover, it is always difficult to decide when the law
punishes an evil-doer-whether it is the law or the preaching of the Church which
restrains others from becoming evil-doers.</p>

<p>As regards the superstitions of the people of London. They were at all times
believers in magic and sorcery, but, as always happens, many of the popular beliefs
seemed often to sleep or to be dead. It was only from time to time that there
occurred an outbreak of belief showing that superstition of this kind still existed
among them. The most notable case, for instance, is that of Eleanor Cobham,
Duchess of Gloucester, whom we heard of at p. 210: she was accused of attempting
to compass the death of Henry the Sixth by means of a magic image. Everybody
seems to have firmly believed this story, which, indeed, may have been perfectly
true. She, however, did penance in the City of London, and was confined for life
in Chester Castle, and the woman who assisted her was put to death. Later on,
Richard the Third endeavoured to make out that Elizabeth Woodville had been
guilty of magic and sorcery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>Other superstitions the people had, and, as at the present day, obscure persons
earned their livelihood by pretending to discover where stolen property was to be
found, and by telling fortunes and the like. A curious superstition is mentioned by
Chaucer. He tells us that, by the help of a bone of a wether’s right shoulder, from
which the flesh had been boiled (not roasted) away, some could tell what was being
done in far countries, “tokens of pees and of werre, the staat of the relme, sleynge
of men, and spousebreche.”</p>

<p>The actual attitude of the people towards the claims and pretensions of the
Church are illustrated by the wills of which I have already made so liberal a use.
(R. Sharpe, <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>.) Thus, as we have seen, it was an article of faith
down to the middle of the sixteenth century that the soul could be released from
purgatory, or could be relieved from many years of purgatory, by good works done
for the Church, by masses said after death, by the prayers of the Religious, or by
securing a share in their merits. Thus, a citizen left money for the maintenance
and decoration of the parish church, for obits, for trentals, <i>i.e.</i> services of thirty
masses, for a daily mass in perpetuity; for so many masses, perhaps a thousand
within three days of death; for the endowment of a chantry, and perhaps the erection
of a Chantry Chapel; for the purchase of books on Church Service, vestments, altar
cloths, Paschal candles, and singing candles. Again, as the maintenance of bridges
was in itself a religious duty, bequests for that purpose were common. In order to
secure a share in the merits of the Religious, bequests were constantly made to all
the orders of the mendicant Friars—the Franciscans or Grey Friars; the Dominicans
or Black Friars; the Carmelites or White Friars; the Augustinian or Austin Friars;
and, though they were not always included, the Crutched Friars, or Friars of the Holy
Cross. With the same object, bequests were made to the hermits, anchorites, and
ankresses.</p>

<p>Bequests were also made—one believes out of sheer charity, apart from any
considerations as to the safety of the soul—to hospitals, such as St. Bartholomew’s,
St. Mary Spital, St. Mary Bethlehem, St. Thomas’s, and the three “Colleges” of
lepers, “Le Loke” of Southwark, St. Giles’ in the Fields, and the House with the
“misil cotes” at Hackney.</p>

<p>Bequests were made to the Prisons, Newgate, Ludgate, Fleet, the two Marshalseas,
the Clink in Southwark, the White Lyon in Southwark, the City Compters,
the Borough Compter, and the Gate House of Westminster. Bequests were also
made to pilgrims, that the testator might enjoy the benefits conferred upon pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>Bequests were made to the poor of the testator’s Company or parish: of clothes
to friends or to kinsfolk: clothes made of fur, silk, satin, and fine cloth, girdles,
chains, daggers, rings, weapons, armour, drinking cups, silver plate, pewter.</p>

<p>The wife, at her husband’s death, was entitled to one-third of the personal
property; she was, however, generally provided for by a dower which exceeded the
amount she could claim. I have already described the vow of perpetual widowhood,
which was not an uncommon thing for a widow to make, according to the form
provided by the Church. Sometimes she took the vows and entered a convent.</p>

<p>The display at funerals, and the ceremonies observed, the hospitality offered,
and the order of the procession, formed a large part in the social life of the time,
especially in times when some great man or other was always dying. The following
is the order of the funeral procession of the fifteenth century, set forth in detail:—First,
for the Burial of a King. (<cite>Archæologia.</cite>)</p>

<p>Next, for the Burial of a person of lower rank:—</p>

<p>(1) The procession begins with a sword offered by the most worshipful man
of the kin.</p>

<p>(2) Next follow those who bear the deceased’s Coat of Worship, his helmet,
and his crest.</p>

<p>(3) Then must be borne banners of the Trinity: of Our Lady, of St. George,
or of the saint, “his avower”—<i>i.e.</i> the patron saint of the deceased, and of his
arms. There must also be a Guidon of his device with his word.</p>

<p>(4) There must be a double vallance about the hearse, above and below, with
his word and his device written around.</p>

<p>(5) There must be twelve scutcheons of his arms affixed to the bars of the
hearse, and three dozen “pinselles to stand above the hearse between the lights.”</p>

<p>(6) There must also be provided as many scutcheons as there are pillars in the
church. Scutcheons may be set up in the four quarters of the church at discretion.</p>

<p>(7) Torches must be carried to the number of the deceased’s years, every torch
to carry a scutcheon.</p>

<p>(8) Before and beside the hearse must walk five officers of arms bearing his
coat of worship, his sword, his helmet, his crest, and his banner of arms, together
with the banners already mentioned of the Holy Trinity, Our Lady, St. George,
and the Saint, his avower.</p>

<p>(9) Cloth of gold for the ladies to give away.</p>

<p>(10) A company of “innocents” in white carrying tapers.</p>

<p>(11) The horse of the dead man, with a man-at-arms carrying the sword or
spear or battle-axe.</p>

<p>(12) The heir must stand beside the priest when offerings are made.</p>

<p>This order, it will be observed, says nothing about the mourners. There
were troops of mourners: the family, the relations, the friends, the servants, until
the long, slow procession, singing, with the Priests of the Papey marching before,
reached the whole length of Cheapside from St. Michael le Querne to St. Mildred’s.</p>

<small>GENERAL</small></h3>


<p>The history of the Monastic Life, with its rise and its decay, its work and its
importance, has attracted many writers and historians. It has been fiercely assailed;
it has been vehemently defended. In speaking of the Dissolution it was necessary
to state plainly the condition into which Monks and Friars had fallen in the
early sixteenth century. (See Appendix VIII.) In this place, and as a fitting preface
to a review in detail of the Monastic Houses of London, it may be permitted to
quote those who could speak in praise of the Religious Life. There are two writers
who seem to say all that can be said in favour of Monasticism. The first was
contemporary with the Dissolution; his work is in MS. in the British Museum.
I quote it at second hand from Cunningham, <cite>Growth of English Industry</cite> (p. 472):</p>

<p>“There was no person that came to them heavy or sad for any cause that
went away comfortless; they never revenged them of any injury, but was content
to forgive it freely upon submission, and if the price of corn had begun to start
up in the market, they made thereunto with a wain load of corn, and sold it under
the market to poor people, to the end to bring down the price thereof. If the
highways, bridges, or causeys were tedious to the passengers that sought their
living by their travel, their great help lacked not toward the repairing and amending
thereof, yea oftentimes they amended them on their own proper charges.</p>

<p>If any poor householder lacked seed to sow his land, or bread, corn, or malt
before harvest, and came to a monastery, either of men or women, he would not
have gone away without help: for he should have had it until harvest, that he
might easily have paid it again. Yea if he had made his moan for an ox, horse,
or cow, he might have had it upon his credit, and such was the good conscience
of the borrowers in those days that the thing borrowed needed not to have been
asked at the day of payment.</p>

<p>They never raised any rent, or took any incomes or garsomes (fines) of their
tenants, nor ever broke in or improved any commons, although the most part and
the greatest waste grounds belonged to their possessions.</p>

<p>If any poor people had made their moan at their day of marriage to any
Abbey, they should have had money given to their great help. And thus all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of people were helped and succoured by abbeys: yea, happy was that person that
was tenant to an abbey, for it was a rare thing to hear that any tenant was
removed by taking his farm over his head, nor he was not afraid of any re-entry
for non-payment of rent, if necessity drove him thereunto. And thus they fulfilled
the works of charity in all the country round about them, to the good example
of all lay parsons that now have taken forth other lessons, that is, <i lang="la">nunc tempus
alios postulat mores</i>.”</p>

<p>The second writer is Tanner in his <cite>Notitia Monastica</cite> (Preface):</p>

<p>“John Wethamsted, Abbot of St. Albans, caused above eighty books to be
transcribed (there was then no printing) during his abbacy. Fifty-eight were
transcribed by the care of one Abbot of Glastonbury, and so zealous were the
monks in general for the work that they often got lands given and churches
appropriated for the carrying of it on. In all the greater abbeys there were also
persons appointed to take notice of the principal occurrences of the kingdom, and,
at the end of every year, to digest them into annals. In these records they
particularly preserved the memories of their founders and benefactors, the years
and days of their births and deaths, their marriages, children, and successors, so
that recourse was sometimes had to them for proving persons’ ages and genealogies,
though it is to be feared that some of these pedigrees were drawn up from tradition
only, and that in most of their accounts they were favourable to their friends and
severe upon their enemies. The constitutions of the clergy in their national and
provincial synods, and (after the Conquest) even Acts of Parliament were sent to
the Abbey to be recorded, which leads me to mention the use and advantage of
these religious houses.</p>

<p>First, The choicest records and treasures in the kingdom were preserved in
them. An exemplification of the Charter of Liberties granted by King Henry
the First was sent to some abbey in every county to be preserved. Charters
and inquisitions relating to the County of Cornwall were deposited in the Priory
of Bodmin; a great many rolls were lodged in the Abbey of Leicester and Priory
of Kenilworth until taken from thence by King Henry the Third. King Edward
the First sent to the religious houses to search for his title to the kingdom of
Scotland in their leigers and chronicles, as the most authentic records for proof
of his right to that crown. When his sovereignty was acknowledged in Scotland,
he sent letters to have it inserted in the chronicles of the Abbey of Winchcomb
and the Priory of Norwich, and, probably, of many other such places. And when
he decided the controversy relating to the crown of Scotland between Robert
Bruce and John Baliol, he wrote to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, London,
requiring them to enter in their chronicles the exemplifications therewith sent of
that decision. The learned Mr. Selden hath his greatest evidences for the
dominion of the narrow seas, belonging to the King of Great Britain, from monastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
records. The evidences and money of private families were oftentimes sent to
these houses to be preserved. The seals of noblemen were deposited there upon
their deaths, and even the King’s money was sometimes lodged in them.</p>

</div>


<p>Secondly, They were schools of learning and education; for every convent
had one person or more appointed for this purpose, and all the neighbours that
desired it might have their children taught grammar and church music without
any expense to them. In the nunneries, also, young women were taught to work
and read English, and sometimes Latin also. So that not only the lower rank
of people, who could not pay for their learning, but most of the noblemen’s and
gentlemen’s daughters were educated in these places.</p>

<p>Thirdly, All the monasteries were, in effect, great hospitals, and were, most
of them, obliged to relieve many poor people every day. They were, likewise,
houses of entertainment for almost all travellers. Even the nobility and gentry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
when they were upon the road, lodged at one religious house and dined at another,
and seldom or never went to inns. In short, their hospitality was such that, in
the Priory of Norwich, 1500 quarters of malt, and above 800 quarters of wheat,
and all other things in proportion, were generally spent every year.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The nobility and gentry provided not only for their old servants
in these houses by corrodies,<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> but for their younger children and impoverished friends
by making them first monks and nuns, and, in time, priors and prioresses, abbots
and abbesses.</p>

<p>Fifthly, They were of considerable advantage to the crown. (1) By the
profits received from the death of one abbot or prior to the election, or, rather,
confirmation of another. (2) By great fines paid for the confirmation of their
liberties. (3) By many corrodies granted to old servants of the crown, and pensions
to the King’s clerks and chaplains till they got preferment.</p>

<p>Sixthly, They were likewise of considerable advantage to the places where
they had their sites and estates. (1) By causing great resort to them, and getting
grants of fairs and markets for them. (2) By freeing them from the Forest Laws.
(3) By letting their land at easy rates.</p>

<p>Lastly, They were great ornaments to the country, many of them were really
noble buildings, and though not actually so grand and neat, yet, perhaps, as much
admired in their times as Chelsea and Greenwich Hospitals are now. Many of
the abbey churches were equal, if not superior, to our present cathedrals, and they
must have been as much an ornament to the country, and employed as many
workmen in building and keeping them in repair, as noblemen’s and gentlemen’s
seats now [1744] do.”</p>

<p>It will be observed as a doubtful advantage that the nobility and gentry
provided for their old servants by corrodies, and had further privileges in the
way of making their own “younger children and impoverished friends” monks
and nuns, abbots and abbesses. But Tanner belonged to a time when it was
still firmly believed that everything good and worth having belonged to gentlefolk,
so that, if the Monastic House was of advantage to them, it must
necessarily be of advantage to the country. In other respects, also, one cannot
altogether agree with the learned writer. If, for instance, the Monastic Houses
kept schools open to all comers, what was the need of founding new schools in
London in the fifteenth century? Nor can it be accepted as proved that the
children of poor parents were admitted either to the abbey or the nunnery school.
Let, however, this plea for the Religious stand. There is enough, and too much,
to be said on the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p><blockquote>

<p>“As to the extent of church property,” Milman remarks (v. 201) “in London and the neighbouring
counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Essex, the church lands must have been enormous. Hardly a parish in
Middlesex which did not belong, certainly so far as manorial rights, to the Bishop of London, the Dean
and Chapter of St. Paul’s, the Abbots and Monks of Westminster, and other Religious Houses; the
Carthusians, St. John Clerkenwell (Hospitallers), Sion, and many smaller foundations. The chapter of
St. Paul’s swept in a broad belt round the north of London till they met the church of Westminster at
Hampstead and Paddington. The Abbot of Westminster was almost a Prince of Westminster.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, to quote from the same writer:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The wealth of the Clergy, the landed property, even with the tithe, was by no means the whole:
and, invaded as it was by aggression, by dilapidation, by alienation through fraud or violence, limited in its
productiveness by usage, by burthens, by generosity, by maladministration, it may be questioned whether
it was the largest part. The vast treasures accumulated by the Avignonese Pontiffs when the Papal
territories were occupied by enemies or adventurers, and could have yielded but scanty revenues, testify to
the voluntary or compulsory tribute paid by Western Christendom to her Supreme Court of Appeal. If
the Bishops mainly depended on their endowments, to the Clergy, to the monastic houses, oblations (in
many cases now from free gifts hardened into rightful demands) were pouring in, and had long been pouring
in, with incalculable profusion. Not only might not the altars, hardly any part of the church might be
approached without a votive gift. The whole life, the death of every Christian was bound up with the
ceremonial of the church: for almost every office was received from the rich and generous the ampler
donation, from the poorer or more parsimonious was exacted the hard-wrung fee. Above all, there were
the masses, which might lighten the sufferings of the soul in purgatory: there was the prodigal gift of the
dying man out of selfish love for himself, the more generous and no less prodigal gift of the bereaved, out
of holy charity for others. The dying man, from the King to the peasant, when he had no further use for
his worldly riches would devote them to this end: the living, out of profound respect or deep affection
for the beloved husband, parent, brother, kinsman, friend, would be, and actually was not less bountiful
and munificent. Add to all this the oblations at the crosses of the Redeemer, or the shrines of popular or
famous saints, for their intercessory prayers to avert the imminent calamity, to assuage the sorrow, or to grant
success to the schemes, it might be, of ambition, avarice, or any other passion, to obtain pardon for sin, to
bring down blessing: crosses and shrines, many of them supposed to be endowed with miraculous powers,
constantly working miracles. To most of these were made perpetual processions, led by the Clergy in
their rich attire. From the basins of gold or the bright florins of the King to the mite of the beggar, all
fell into the deep insatiable box which unlocked its treasures to the Clergy. Besides all these estates,
tithes, oblations, bequests to the Clergy and the monasteries, reckon the subsidies in kind to the Mendicants
in their four Orders—Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, Carmelites. In every country of Latin
Christendom, of these swarms of Friars, the lowest obtained sustenance: the higher, means to build up
and maintain splendid churches, cloisters, houses. They were a vast standing army, far more vast than
any maintained by any kingdom in Christendom: at once levying subsidies to an enormous amount and
living at free quarters throughout the land.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Any investigation into the conditions of monastic life brings the reader into
many strange and unexpected places. At first, probably, he is impatient over the
futility of the life, the loss of the old ideals, the worship of a Rule which is broken
away and disregarded at every point, the contrast between the profession of sanctity
and the life of idleness. Presently, he begins to understand that at its worst the
monastery always presented some kind of example, if only in its freedom from
violence, and in a discipline, lax perhaps, but far more severe than could be found
outside. And then he observes how much was done by the monastery, and how
much was expected of it. I do not suppose that the indiscriminate charity enjoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
upon the brethren, and always practised by them, was favourable to the repression
of mendicity, and the discouragement of the tramp and masterless man. Still there
is always the immediate need of the starving and the sick and the suffering, which
should be met without too jealous questioning into records and antecedents. We
need not ask what contributions to Mediæval Literature and Learning were made
by this or that convent: it is enough to know that here was a Library, and that
here the monks set up reading boxes in their cloisters for those who wished to study.
The example was there. We need not ask how far the town folk or the village
folk were admitted to the monastery school, or if it was used only for the children
of noble parents confided to the Abbot for education. The school was there, it
was an example. We need not, even, pry too closely into the private lives of the
Religious, though I think that as a rule they were as blameless as could be expected,
considering the time and the manners: the example was there: the rule of chastity,
temperance, obedience, and contempt of wealth.</p>

<p>Again, the reader cannot fail, presently, to understand the eagerness, the
pathetic eagerness, with which the people ran after every new Order of Religion
which appeared. One after the other, they were Reformers: they would introduce
a sterner discipline, fiercer austerities. One after the other they fell off; the
pristine zeal cooled; the new Order followed in the same lines as the old; the
brethren preserved the letter and threw away the spirit. Most pathetic of all is
the respect, the admiration, the awe, with which the people regarded the Franciscans
in their first splendid self-devotion. They saw a company to whom nothing was
unclean, nothing was beneath their care, no criminal too base, no wretched woman
too low for them, no disease too loathsome, no hovel or den too filthy for the
bearers of consolation and of succour to approach. What could be too good,
too costly, too precious for such men? They would accept no endowment.
They lived on the broken meats of charity. Then let their church be adorned;
let the pillars bear aloft the roof over chapels and altars ablaze with gold and
lights; let their sacred vessels be of gold—nothing less would serve; let the
vestments be of cloth of gold and silver. And so on until the dreadful suspicion arose
that the Grey Friars were not so holy and so devoted as of old. They lived upon
their reputation for a hundred years and more; and for a hundred years to follow
they slowly decayed, until there was no reproach too bitter, no invective too
vehement, for the poor Franciscan.</p>

<p>Again, as to the uses to which their Houses were put. They were sanctuaries;
they were hospitals; they were places of education for the sons of nobles; they
were places of training for young ecclesiastics: great ladies, whom it was not
politic to punish with imprisonment were sent to a Monastic House, where they
were allowed everything except the liberty of leaving it. Thus Queen Katharine
of Valois, after the discovery of her secret marriage, was sent to Bermondsey Abbey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
till she died: Queen Elizabeth Woodville, who surely must have proved all the
miseries that belong to a crown, was also sent to Bermondsey. Dame Badlesmere,
after her husband’s execution, was sent to the Clares of London. Then we find
the King’s clerks expecting a pension for one of their body whenever a new
Abbot or Prior was elected: and we find the King sending his old and incompetent
servants to the Monastic Houses for maintenance for the remainder of their lives.
Of those who professed much, more was expected.</p>

<p>In a word, what we find in these glimpses of monastic life is that it is all so
human—so intensely human. Did we expect anything else? Yes, the Rule
demands a life that is superhuman: therefore the Rule breaks down. Its weakness
is that men cannot endure it; yet they have taken the vows; they cannot
break free from the Rule; but they may introduce alleviations and palliatives—in
every Monastic House there was the Misericordia, where indulgences were granted
and conferred.</p>

<p>So we begin with prejudice and with contempt, and we end with sympathy
and pity. After so many years we no longer feel, though we may understand,
the exasperation with which the abuse of the Monastic system came to be regarded:
the accumulation of vast estates in the hands of a multitude who toiled not neither
did they spin: who professed an austere Rule and lived a luxurious life: who
despised wealth but enjoyed all that wealth could give: who pretended to pay no
regard to birth yet admitted into their ranks none but those of gentle blood: with
whom the difference between profession and practice was monstrous and scandalous.</p>

<p>I have said that when the Rule was too hard for men to obey, they made for
themselves alleviations.</p>

<p>There was one Rule at least where, so far as one can learn, no alleviations
were practised; in this Rule men had to conform or be broken in the attempt.
It was the Rule of the Carthusians. It was so austere as to seem well-nigh
impossible of observance; but it was observed; nay, it was loved: Sir Thomas
More lived with the brethren for a time and practised all their austerities; he would
have continued to live with them; he desired nothing better than to live and die
under a Rule which repressed all natural desires, but the brethren would not receive
him: they sent him out into the world to do a nobler work among the people of
his age and of the generations to come.</p>

<small>ST. MARTIN’S-LE-GRAND</small></h3>


<p>This foundation, by reason of its antiquity and religious objects, should have been
venerable, but it became, by its claims, privileges, and position, an institution hateful
and detestable, long before the Monastic Houses fell into disrepute. It had its
origin certainly before the Conquest, but how long before cannot be ascertained.
Tradition made Wythred, King of Kent, its founder in the seventh century. We
need not trouble ourselves with the reasons which make this tradition impossible.
Safe ground is touched about the year 1056, when St. Martin’s was either founded,
or endowed, by Ingelric and Girard [Edward], two brothers, for a Dean and
Secular Canons. In 1068 a Charter was granted to the College by William:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I William, etc.... grant, and by my royal authority for ever corroborate and confirm to God and
the Church of the blessed Martin, situate within the walls of London, which the aforesaid Ingelric and
Girard his brother, from their own revenues, and in atonement of their faults, honourable built to the praise
of God, and for the Canonical Rule therein to be held and observed for ever. Now these are the names of
the lands, Estre in Essex, with the Berewic of Maissebery and Norton, and Stanford, and Fobbinge, and
Benedict, and Christehal, and Tolesfunte, and Rowenhal, and Angre, together with their appendages, the
meadows, pastures, woods, mills, and all to them belonging; and in Benefleot one hide, and in Hoddesdon
one hide, also the church of Mealdon with two hides of Land, and the tithes and all things to it appertaining.
Moreover also, on my own part, I give and grant to the said Church, for the redemption of the
souls of my father and mother, all the land and moor without the postern, which is called Cripelesgate on
either side of the postern, to wit, from the Northern angle of the City wall, where a rivulet of springs, near
thereto flowing, marks it out (<i>i.e.</i> the moor) from the wall, as far as the running-water which enters the City.
I grant to it besides all the Churches and all the tithes, lands also and houses, which the faithful in Christ
have already given to it within and without London, or shall in future bestow....</p></blockquote>

<p>This Charter was renewed or confirmed by Henry the First and by Stephen.</p>

<p>Among the various historical points connected with St. Martin’s, the following
may be noted as the most important.</p>

<p>Henry the Second granted to the Canons a free court of all their men and
tenants: they were not to be impleaded out of it except before the King and the
Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The Saddlers’ Guild became connected with the Church of St. Martin’s—a fact
which shows that the college was not wholly regarded as a sanctuary for criminals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>In 1235 Henry the Third upheld the Canons’ Court against the City.</p>

<p>The erection of St. Leonard’s Parish Church on the confines of the Precinct in
1236 points to a restriction of St. Martin’s Church to the College or sanctuary.
But there are other instances, <i>e.g.</i> that of St. Catherine Cree, in which a parish
church was, for convenience, built outside the Monastic Precinct.</p>

<p>The buildings of St. Martin’s were improved and rebuilt by its Dean, William
de Wykeham, about 1367.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent the Third exempted the Royal Chapels from Excommunication
or Interdict.</p>

<div class="caption">THE SANCTUARY OF ST. MARTIN’S-LE-GRAND<br />
From Strype’s <cite>Stow</cite>, 1754 edition.</div>
</div>

<p>Edward the First forbade Cardinals sent from Rome to receive procuration
from St. Martin’s.</p>

<p>In 14 Edw. II. the College, under a <i lang="la">Quo Warranto</i> heard at the Tower,
relinquished any claim to receive toll within the City.</p>

<p>By Rich. II. St. Martin’s was exempted from tenths, fifteenths, tallages, aids,
and all contributions or quotas by the King.</p>

<p>St. Martin’s was by far the largest, the safest, and the best-protected of all the
English sanctuaries. The meaning and the development of the theory of sanctuary
have been considered already (p. 201). At first it meant little more than a
temporary asylum, where criminals could find shelter while they sought for means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
redeem their offence by paying the penalty attached by Saxon Law. Every
Monastic House, every church, the King’s Palace, were all sanctuaries. But a
sanctuary within the walls of the City, which was not a place of temporary refuge,
not a place, such as a church, in which the fugitive could be starved into surrender,
but a place in which every kind of criminal might find an asylum and safe retreat for
life, a place which practically defied the arm of the Law and the hand of Justice, was
certain to become an intolerable burden to a law-abiding city. And so St. Martin’s
actually did become. Again and again the City of London revolted in vain against
its powers; again and again cases were vainly laid in the courts against the Dean
and Chapter.</p>

<p>The Precinct is almost exactly occupied by the present Post Office and
Telegraph Offices of St. Martin’s-le-Grand.</p>

<p>About the year 1285 it was judged expedient to close a lane leading from St.
Vedast, Foster Lane, to St. Nicholas Shambles through the Precinct of St. Martin’s
because it had become the safe haunt for thieves and rogues.</p>

<p>In 1381, during Wat Tyler’s rebellion, Roger Legat, “quest monger” or
collector, was torn from the High Altar of St. Martin’s and beheaded in Cheapside.</p>

<p>In 1405 the citizens petitioned Henry the Fourth for the abolition of St.
Martin’s privileges as to sanctuary, on the ground that it sheltered murderers,
thieves, and fraudulent debtors. It was, however, impossible to hope that Henry,
who owed his crown largely to the support of the Church, could do anything so
contrary to ecclesiastical privilege. It is perhaps astonishing that so simple a plan
as the removal of the College bodily to some place in the country, or, at least,
without the walls of the City, should not have been suggested.</p>

<p>In 1416 one Henry Kneve, who had taken sanctuary, fled for some reason,
leaving behind him a quantity of valuables which he had stolen. These were seized
by the Dean’s officers as waif. One would have thought that they would have been
restored to their owners.</p>

<p>We have seen (p. 205) the case of the year 1422, when the City fought with all
its powers, and by means of its most learned men.</p>

<p>In 1430 the Mayor and Sheriffs withdrew by force from sanctuary a certain
Canon. They were, however, compelled to restore him.</p>

<p>One Matthew Philip, Alderman of Aldersgate Ward, denied the right of St.
Martin’s Lane, which ran through the Precinct, to be privileged, and demanded
certain payments on account of taxes or tallage to be paid there. On being refused,
he levied by distress. He, too, had to give way, and offered the Dean, by way of
reconciliation, a supper.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that sanctuary men lived in St. Martin’s for nothing.
On the contrary, the great cost of living within the Precinct was a source of
considerable profit to the Canons, and was doubtless one of the reasons why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
place was continued. Many of the refugees took advantage of the immunities
of the place to make counterfeit goldsmiths’ work. Hence the phrase “false
St. Martin’s beads.” It is noteworthy, however, that in 1447 the Goldsmiths’
Company, by permission of the Dean, although against the privileges of the place,
searched the Precinct, and took away all the counterfeit work they could find, while
the Dean consigned the offenders to the College Prison.</p>

<p>St. Martin’s, during the Wars of the Roses, served as a refuge and an asylum
for many persons of consideration. William Oldehall, the Duke of York’s
Chamberlain, was one of them. Henry demanded his surrender, but withdrew his
order. Shortly after, Oldehall was charged with breaking sanctuary in order to
commit murder. The Alderman of Aldersgate broke into St. Martin’s and carried
him off, but, as in every other case, had to bring him back with gifts of atonement
to the Canons.</p>

<p>In 1455 the City was highly provoked by the lawlessness of the sanctuary
men. The Mayor and Aldermen, at the head of the citizens, forced the
sanctuary and took out the ringleaders. The Dean complained, but it was the
time of the outbreak of the Civil Wars, and his complaint appears to have passed
unheeded.</p>

<p>In the following year the sanctuary men joined the citizens in attacking aliens.
But, indeed, the fact proves nothing except the readiness of the lawless to commit
lawless actions.</p>

<p>In 1457 the following Articles were drawn up for the reformation of the
sanctuary, no doubt in deference to the complaints of the citizens:—</p>

<p>The Dean was to be sworn to keep the said Articles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Refugees to make known their reasons for taking sanctuary, and the same to be registered in a
book with the refugee’s name.</p>

<p>(2) Refugees to deliver up weapons or armour, except a pointless knife for meat.</p>

<p>(3) A notorious thief entering the sanctuary must give good security for the time he remains there
and three months after; failing such security, he is to be committed to ward, in the sanctuary, but may
depart from the sanctuary if he will.</p>

<p>(4) The outer gates and posterns of the sanctuary to be closed from 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Allhallows to
Candlemas, and the rest of the year from 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, or till the commencement of the first mass
there. Refugees for felony or treason to remain in sanctuary all night.</p>

<p>(5) Fugitives to be deprived of stolen goods they may bring into the sanctuary, and the same to be
restored if possible to the owners. No one to buy such goods in the sanctuary, but if such purchase be
proved, the buyer to make satisfaction to the owner.</p>

<p>(6) Any sanctuary man leaving the sanctuary to commit crime, is to be put to ward in the sanctuary,
and if he wish to depart the sanctuary he shall do so at a given hour in daytime.</p>

<p>(7) Persons guilty of certain offences, as lock-picking, forgers of seals, evidences, workers of counterfeit
gold and silver work not to be suffered in the sanctuary. Persons suspected of such to be committed
to ward till they find sufficient security.</p>

<p>(8) Vicious persons not to be “suspected” in the sanctuary. If any be there, they to be put to
open ward in the daytime till shame cause them to depart, or they amend their evil ways.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>
<p>(9) That deceitful games be not played in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>(10) Barbers and artificers to keep Sundays as the citizens of London do, if they break this ordinance
they to be put in ward. They to use their crafts according to the ordinances of the same City.</p>

<p>(11) Every person taking sanctuary to be sworn on a book, to obey these ordinances.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among others who took sanctuary in St. Martin’s during the Civil Wars were
the Countess of Oxford; Anne Neville, afterwards Richard’s Queen; and Miles
Forrest, one of the murderers of the young Princes in the Tower. The tradition
was that he “rotted away piecemeal”—probably he was one of the late victims to
leprosy, which was then rapidly vanishing.</p>

<p>In 1498 Henry the Seventh endowed the Abbey of Westminster and his Lady
Chapel there with St. Martin’s-le-Grand, so that the Abbot became the Dean of the
College. A new seal was made. Also a new and a more powerful defender of
sanctuary was created. It was not until 1548, when all chantries, free chapels, and
brotherhoods were granted to the King, that the College was dissolved and the
church was demolished. Even then the privileges of sanctuary survived, though
under greatly modified conditions.</p>

<p>The church, as appeared from the excavations in 1818, was more than 200 feet
long. After it was pulled down, tenements called the New Rents were erected on
its site. On the place of the high altar was a wine tavern.</p>

<p>During the reign of Elizabeth, most of the inhabitants were foreigners—French,
German, Dutch, and Scotch. By the freedom of the Precinct they could trade
without being free of the City: among them were shoemakers, tailors, buttermakers,
goldsmiths, purse-makers, stationers, silk weavers, and silk throwsters.
The number of the foreigners of St. Martin’s in 1593 was 196.</p>

<p>In 1697 whatever privileges of sanctuary remained were abolished.</p>

<p>The Act of 1815, providing for the site of the new Post Office, reserved to the
inhabitants the right to trade without being freemen of the City; the Court of
St. Martin’s remained undisturbed; and the inhabitants were entitled to vote at
Parliamentary Elections as Electors of Westminster.</p>

<p>There is an immense mass of material in connection with this ancient House,
but the above seems to embody the matters of importance. It may be added that
the College possessed considerable property outside Aldersgate; that St. Botolph’s
Church was united with St. Martin’s in 1399, and seems to have been farmed to the
Priory of St. Bartholomew. The French Protestant Church, now in Soho Square,
was situated in St. Martin’s from 1841 to 1877.</p>

<p>St. Martin’s was one of the churches where the Curfew Bell was rung every
night; the other churches, from time to time, being those of St. Mary-le-Bow,
St. Laurence, St. Giles Cripplegate, and All Hallows Barking.</p>

<p>The common opinion of the citizens in the sixteenth century regarding the
sanctuary is set forth by Stow. He, it must be remembered, was able to recollect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the actual working of sanctuary, while St. Martin’s was still a living and acting
Foundation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This St. Martin’s appears to have been a Sanctuary for great Disorders, and a shelter for the loosest
sort of People: Rogues and Ruffians, Thieves and Felons and Murderers. From hence used to rush
violent persons, Committers of Riots, Robberies, and Manslaughters: Hither they brought in their preys
and stolen goods, and concealed them here, and shared or sold them to those that dwelt here. Here were
also harboured Picklocks, Counterfeiters of Keys and Seals, Forgers of false Evidences, such as made
counterfeit chains, beads, ouches plate, Copper gilt for gold: nay, common strumpets and Bawds,
Gamesters and Players at Hazard and Dice, and other unlawful games. And lastly profaners of Sundays,
and other Festival days, exercising their crafts thereon.</p>

<p>And again, to this licentiousness was this Sanctuary grown in these times, that in Henry VII.’s reign,
one coming hither for Sanctuary, the Sheriffs took him thence by violence, and brought him away. But
observe what followed: The Abbot of Westminster (to whom this college now belonged) in the year of
Henry VII. exhibited a bill to the king against these sheriffs for arresting and drawing out with force a
privileged person, out of the sanctuary of St. Martin’s belonging to the said Abbey. Which matter was
heard in the Court of the Star Chamber, before the Lords and others of the King’s Counsel, and Hody
and Newton, chief Justices. Which Justices determined that by Law, the Party ought to enjoy the
privilege of sanctuary: and the Sheriffs were grievously fined by particular named.” (Stow’s <cite>Survey</cite>, vol. i.)</p></blockquote>

<p>After the Dissolution some of the liberties of the place, as we have seen,
remained. And the last condition of the precinct was almost worse than the first.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Because of the Liberty enjoyed by such as lived within these bounds, many Foreigners, English
and others, Tradesmen and Artificers, planted themselves here. In 1585 a Survey was taken of all the
strangers, being French, German, Dutch and Scots, inhabiting here and their occupations. Many of them
were cordwainers, that is shoemakers (which trade still continues there), Taylors (hence the tallymen
who sold shreds of Cloth; and Button makers, and Button-mold-makers, that remained there even until
the great Fire in my remembrance). Here inhabited also Strangers, Goldsmiths, Purse-makers, Linen-drapers,
some Stationers, some Merchants, silk weavers. Here lived also two silk twisters, who I suppose
were the first silk throwers in London, and brought the trade into England. And for remembrance
sake, I shall set down their names: the one was John James, born under the Dominion of King Philip,
and made Denizen the 19th of December, the 10th of the Queen. The other was Anthony Emerick,
born also under the obedience of King Philip, and made Denizen the 1st of January an 17 regin
Elisabethæ. There were also upon that survey aforesaid, found to be of householders (Denizens as well
as others), their Wives, Children, and Servants, one hundred and fifty in number. Which nevertheless was
less by half than was some years before: for in 1569 their number was 269. There was a Constable and a
Headborough for this liberty. But divers things here wanted provided for: in respect whereof they that
lived out of the Liberty were in better condition. Sundry of the inhabitants refused to watch and ward,
when upon occasion they were required, as good subjects and honest neighbours so to do. They refused to
contribute to such taxes and payments as were set upon them for Her Majesty’s service, with the rest of
their neighbours. Several visited with the sickness would not obey the Orders appointed in that behalf:
that is, they would not keep their doors and windows shut, nor keep themselves within their houses: but
walked forth, and struck out the red cross set upon their doors, and threatened mischief to any that should
come to set crosses there. And some repaired to the Court with their Wares, a thing dangerous to the
Queen and Nobility. There was no prison in the said liberty to commit such as should be troublesome
and offensive, but the Gatehouse in Westminster: which was in another Shire, and out of the Liberty.
And so they that were thus committed, commonly brought their actions against those that committed them,
and put them to great trouble.</p>

<p>Hence in the year 1593, the officers and inhabitants petitioned the Lord Treasurer to grant them
such good ordinances for the redress of the said disorders, and sufficient authority for the execution of the
same, for the good government of the said liberty: and conversation of the people in peace: as to his
Lordship’s discreet wisdom should be thought fit. And that they might have a prison and execution of
justice within the precinct of their liberty. And that he would send his letters to the Constable and
Headborough, to find out a convenient place for such purpose: and to assess all the inhabitants of the
liberty to the charge thereof. The Lord Treasurer recommended this matter to Serjeant Owen, and
Mr. Lewis, Lawyers: who gave their Judgments, that for all matters for the service of the Queen, the
inhabitants were compelled to perform the same. But for other matters, they must make some Bye-Laws
and Orders among themselves, to bind themselves to performance.” (Maitland.)</p></blockquote>

<small>THE PRIORY OF THE HOLY TRINITY, OR CHRIST CHURCH PRIORY</small></h3>


<p>This once rich and flourishing House was founded in the year 1108 by Maud, wife
of Henry the First, owing, it is said, to the persuasion, if that pious Queen wanted
any persuasion, of Anselm.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This church was given to Norman, first canon regular in all England. The said queen also gave
unto the same church, and those that served God therein, the plot of Aldgate, and the soke thereunto
belonging, with all customs so free as she had held the same, and twenty-five pound blankes, which she
had of the city of Excester, as appeareth by her deed wherein she nameth the house Christ’s church, and
reporteth Aldgate to be of her domains, which she granteth, with two parts of the rent of the city of
Excester. Norman took upon him to be prior of Christ’s church, in the year of Christ 1108, in the
parishes of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Michael, St. Katherine, and the Blessed Trinity, which now was made
but one parish of the Holy Trinity, and was in old time of the Holy Cross or Holy Rood parish. The
priory was built on a piece of ground in the parish of St. Katherine towards Aldgate, which lieth in length
betwixt the King’s street, by the which men go towards Aldgate, near to the chapel of St. Michael towards
the north, and containeth in length eighty-three ells, half, quarter, and half-quarter of the king’s iron elm,
and lieth in breadth, etc. The soke and ward of Aldgate was then bounded as I have before showed.
The queen was a means also that the land and English Knighten Guild was given unto the prior Norman:
the honourable man, Geffrey de Glinton, was a great helper therein, and obtained that the canons might
enclose the way betwixt their church and the wall of the city, etc. This priory, in process of time, became
a very fair and large church, rich in lands and ornaments, and passed all the priories in the city of London
or shire of Middlesex; the prior whereof was an alderman of London, to wit, of Portsoken ward.</p>

<p>I read, that Eustacius, the eighth prior, about the year 1264, because he would not deal with temporal
matters, instituted Theobald Fitz Ivon, alderman of Portsoken ward under him, and that William Rising,
prior of Christ’s church, was sworn alderman of the said Portsoken ward in the 1st of Richard II.
These priors have sitten and ridden amongst the aldermen of London, in livery like unto them, saving
that his habit was in shape of a spiritual person, as I myself have seen in my childhood; at which time
the prior kept a most bountiful house of meat and drink, both for rich and poor, as well within the house
as at the gates, to all comers, according to their estates.” (Stow’s <cite>Survey</cite>, vol. i.)</p></blockquote>

<p>What happened many years afterwards with the Franciscans happened then in
the case of these brethren of the Augustine Order. Their piety, their austerity,
the endless offering of prayer and praise which ascended from their chapel deeply
moved the hearts of the people. The endowment at first consisted of £25
a year, equivalent to about £750 a year of our money, if there be any certainty as
to the comparative value of money, together with the proceeds of the port called
Aldgate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>In the year 1125 a very singular event greatly increased the possessions and
the wealth of this House. I mean the conveyance of the property held in trust by
the Cnihten Gild to the Priory of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, Pope Immanuel the First, by a Bull, confirmed the House
in all their possessions, including “two parts of Issues of the City of Exon the
Lands of Lestune, which Prince de Moulins and Adeline his wife out of piety
granted to the same place, the land and the soke of the English Cnihten Gild, the
Church of Bix with its rents, and the church of Tottenham.” Many other possessions
fell to the House as time went on.</p>

<p>The Priory stood upon a triangular piece of ground, of which Aldgate and
Leadenhall Street, as far as St. Catherine’s Cree Church inclusive, formed the
south-west side; Cree Church Street, King Street, and Duke Street, the east side;
and the wall of London the north side. The square called St. James’s Place is
certainly the site of a former court of the Priory. The church probably stood on
the site of St. James’s Church, which was built in 1622 partly of materials belonging
to the old church, just as on the site of Grey Friars Church was erected the present
Christ Church. The Precinct of the monastery covered nearly the whole of four
ancient City parishes, viz. St. Mary Magdalene, St. Michael, St. Catherine, and
the Blessed Trinity, amalgamated into one Parish, with, at first, the Convent Church
for Parish Church, called Holy Trinity or Holy Rood. The inhabitants of St.
Catherine’s, however, could not be reconciled to the loss of their church, and
presently built another for themselves in the Churchyard of the Priory. The
Church of St. Michael continued as a ruin, of which the crypt remained one of the
most remarkable of the monuments of ancient London, down to the formation of
the Underground Railway in the year 1865. It was then, most unfortunately,
allowed to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Ancient and rich and venerable as was this Priory, whose monks enjoyed
the reputation of splendid hospitality, the House in later years seems to
have lost some of the consideration for sanctity which it enjoyed during the
first century of its existence. This is shown by the meagre list of monuments
belonging to the Priory Church compared with that of the Grey Friars or
the Dominicans. Henry Fitz Ailwyn, first Mayor of London; two children of
King Stephen; and Geoffrey Mandeville (after his twenty years of dangling
above ground) are among the few remarkable names in Stow’s list of those
here interred.</p>

<p>I have before me thirty-seven closely written pages containing extracts from
ancient documents and archives bearing on the four hundred years’ life of this
House. It is a history which might be told once for all by a Dugdale and confided
to the shelves of the Society of Antiquaries: it contains the story of the management
of a large estate; the usual crop of ecclesiastical quarrels and disputes over rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
and claims; the recognition of the said rights by Pope and King; dispensations,
faculties, injunctions, and restraints.</p>

<p>For instance, in 1250, the Archbishop of Canterbury issued sentence against
Prior, Sub-prior, Sacristan, Cellarer, and Precentor of Holy Trinity for refusing to
receive him as Visitor. The sentence is annulled by superior authority. But two
years later the Pope ordered the Prior to admit the Archbishop, the Metropolitan,
as Visitor. Citizens bequeathed money in order to found an obit, or anniversary for
the benefit of their souls; the Bishop of London was consecrated in their Church;
the heart of John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, was buried in their church;
the Prior, on his election, was sworn as Alderman of Portsoken; citizens of well-known
names turn up unexpectedly in these pages; thus, John Bocuinte, son of
Geoffrey Bocuinte, and Juliana his wife, sold certain property with fees held of the
Priory; Gilbert Fitz Fulk, one of the Aldermen of the thirteenth century, going to
the Holy Land, bequeathed, in case of his death, certain lands and houses to the
Priory for the good of his soul, and the souls of his father and mother; other
citizens desired to be buried in the church; the King asked for the loan of a cart
and horses to carry his household gear to Dover; on the election of a new Prior
the House was bound to provide a benefice for one of the King’s Clerks—see
Tanner’s <cite>Notes on Monastic Houses</cite>,—others of the King’s officers for divers
reasons were maintained by the House—it seems, indeed, a common practice for
the King to have invited this House to maintain his old servants. At one time
the Priory became owner of the market called Queenhithe. William of Ypres gave
it to the House. It was then called Edredes hyde, and the gift was subject to a
yearly payment of £20 to the Hospital of St. Katherine by the Tower.</p>

<p>In 1352 we find the brethren seeking assistance in rebuilding this Church and
House by offering a “Relaxation” of one year and forty days of “enjoined penance”
to any who would assist. The offer to hold good for ten years. At this time the
House possessed property in eighty-eight London parishes. In the reign of
Edward the Second mention is made of three Grammar schools, of which one is that
of the Holy Trinity Priory.</p>

<p>During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the House flourished and obtained
considerable additions to its estates, so that it became the richest of all the London
Houses. Its good fortune, however, did not continue. Its property decreased in
value; much of it was sold; the decay continued; in the year 1532 the Prior and
the Canons held a Chapter in which they recognised that their House was not only
sunken and decayed in its rents and emoluments, but that it was entirely reduced
and laden with debt. They therefore surrendered their House and remaining lands
to the King.</p>

<p>The site was given with all the buildings to Sir Thomas Audley, afterwards
Lord Chancellor. Audley offered the great church, just as it stood, with its peal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
bells, to the adjacent parish of St. Catherine, meaning that they should pull down
the latter and build upon the site. Unhappily, the parishioners were afraid to accept
the offer, “having doubts in their heads,” says Stow, “of afterclaps.” If they had
accepted, another fine Monastic Church would have been preserved, together with
those of St. Mary Overies and St. Bartholomew the Great.</p>

<p>Whereupon Audley pulled down the Church himself with a great deal of
expense and labour. On the death of Audley, his daughter and heiress, Margaret,
became the second wife of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. The Duke was
executed for high treason in 1572; the mansion went to his son, by Margaret, who
sold it in 1592 to the Mayor and Corporation of the City.</p>

<p>Some remains of the buildings were standing until recently. The place itself
seems to have been occupied by the Jews on their return under Oliver Cromwell.
For nearly two hundred years it was almost entirely the Jews’ Quarter in London.
Every year they held a kind of Fair on the Feast of Purim in Duke’s Place. The
Feast, which falls in the month of Adar, <i>i.e.</i> partly in February and partly in March,
commemorates the execution of Haman and the deliverance of the Hebrews. The
Fair was held without any authority until early in the nineteenth century, when it
was licensed for three days, generally extended to six, the square of Duke’s Place
being let for shows. It was found to be a public nuisance, and was suppressed a few
years later.</p>

<p>For many years after the destruction of the Priory Church, the inhabitants of
the Precinct had no parish church of their own. In 1622, however, St. James’s was
built as a parish church for the Precinct. The church became notorious for the
irregular marriages without banns or license which were solemnised here. In 1874
the curacy of St. James’s was united with that of St. Catherine Cree, and the former
church was pulled down.</p>

<p>The Precinct was privileged, and though within the City, persons not freemen
of the City were permitted to trade within its limits.</p>


<p>PRIORY OF HOLY TRINITY
AND CHURCH OF ST. KATHERINE CREE</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These plans were made by a surveyor named J. Symans in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
From the mention of Sir Thomas Heneage’s garden, their date is probably before 1595, when
Sir Thomas, who was Keeper of the Tower Records, died. The first shows the ground floor
of the buildings then standing. The original monastery extended from the street, now called
Leadenhall Street, northward and eastward to the old Wall. Two semicircular bastions and
a third which formed one tower of Aldgate are seen on the plans, which also, among items
otherwise unknown hitherto to London topographers, give us the canon’s church as well
as that of the parishioners of St. Katherine Cree. Both these buildings have now disappeared.
The conventual church in Symans’ plan had already been in part removed by Lord Chancellor
Audley, in favour of the “Ivye Chamber.” The “Charncell” is still intact and “owre
Ladychapell”; but there is notice of “the north end where the great tower fell Downe”
and “the south end now teniment.” By “end,” Symans meant transept. The cloister and
the chapter house, one portion of which is labelled “This was the chapell,” the body of the
church and a south porch are clearly denoted; while, of the domestic buildings, we distinguish
the gatehouse labelled “The way owte of Allgat Streat into Creechurch monastary”: the
Dorter, or sleeping quarters of the monks, which open from the cloister; more than one
extensive garden; the “Greate Cowrte,” and a number of apartments or separate small
holdings, let to various tenants, whose names, Awnsell, Bayle, and Kirwin, for example, occur
in several places on the plans. At the north side of “the Great Garden adioyning the
Dorter” and close to the city wall, is “A Foundation for new buildings uppon the wall”;
this seems to be let to Awnsell, who has also a lease of the garden. The north chancel aisle
is let in “new Teniments.” Some relics of the vaults, or “Favlts,” are occasionally disclosed
in Leadenhall Street; some Norman arches are figured by Malcolm and there are others in
Pennant’s <cite>London</cite>, 1793, and many other books; but no Tudor plan of the buildings has
hitherto been published.</p></blockquote>

<p><small>These are quite the most important (archæologically) of any of the illustrations in this book. Neither of them has been
reproduced elsewhere. The originals are in the Marquess of Salisbury’s Hatfield House MSS., and the late Marquess gave
permission for them to be used. They were sent to the British Museum for safety and were photographed there. It will be
noticed that these plans show not only the disposition of the whole of the priory buildings, church, chapels, cloister, dormitory,
etc., but also the ground plan of St. Katherine Cree, the position of the upper bastions of London Wall, and the direction of
the lanes and streets thereabouts. They provide the basis for a wealth of discovery.</small></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The second plan is labelled, “This second story or grownd Plat of Creechurch is drawn
by J. Symans.” In it we see “Ivy Chamber” and close by the south transept let to “Darsey.”
The upper floor of the Dorter, with “the gallery to the Dorter,” “a great Kitchen,” “a privy
Kitchen,” and “The Great Tower,” which stood at the north-west corner of the nave, so as to
be close to the entrance to “the body of the church,” by the west door, are all seen.</p>

<p>In both the plans the parish church appears where the present one is still, at the corner
of Leadenhall Street and St. Mary Axe. This street is inscribed “A lane to London Wall
from Allgat Streat”; and, after a turn past one of the smaller priory gates, “The waye from
the monastary in to Allgat Streat.” The church fills a corner of the priory wall and is irregular
in shape, with apparently a tower at the corner, under which is an entrance to the street.
From the frequency of the window openings it would appear to have been in the Perpendicular
style. It was in this building that the body of Hans Holbein, the artist, was buried at his
death of the plague, while painting in Lord Audley’s house in November 1543. This church
was ruinous in 1624. Two years earlier the parishioners nearer Aldgate built themselves
a church, St. James’s, Duke’s Place, which stood very near, if not exactly on, the site of the
Lady Chapel of the conventual church. It also fell out of repair and was pulled down in
1874, the parish being united with St. Katherine’s, which meanwhile, namely, in 1631, had
been rebuilt by Archbishop Laud, and occupies the space shown by Symans, together with
a narrow aisle taken from “the church yarde,” on the north side. This may perhaps be
defined by a narrow passage shown in the ground plan along the wall of the church, and
has hitherto been supposed to have formed part of the cloister. Churches, like this one for
parishioners, occur in many other convents—St. Alban’s and Westminster Abbey, for instance.</p></blockquote>

<small>THE CHARTER HOUSE</small></h3>


<p>In Agas’ Map of London, “Civitas Londinum,” <i lang="la">circa</i> 1560 (see end of <cite>London in the
Time of the Tudors</cite>), there is represented, lying on the west of Aldersgate Street,
an irregular square or place called Charter House Square: it has a small church
in the middle, and on the north side are monastic buildings; on the north of these
are gardens and orchards; one of them with a small building which may be meant
for a church enclosed with a wall. Some of these monastic buildings, with later
additions and alterations, still remain to the present day; the square remains, but
the orchards and gardens are built over, with the exception of the ground once
enclosed by the cloister, which is now the play-ground of the Merchant Taylors’
School. Before the middle of the fourteenth century this place formed part of “No
Man’s Land,” a swampy plain, covered, like Smithfield and Moorfield, with ponds
and reeds and rushes. In the year 1349 the Black Death arrived; and as the City
churchyards were becoming so full that they could hold no more, the Bishop of
London bought a piece of this ground which he enclosed for a burial-place, building
a chapel, “which is now,” says Stow, “enlarged and made a dwelling-house,” and
the place was called Pardon Churchyard. It was afterwards used as a burial-place
for suicides and criminals and persons who died a violent death. The body was put
into a cart, hung with black cloth, belonging to St. John’s Hospital; on the black
cloth was the white cross of St. John; within the cart hung a bell which rang with
the jolting and the shaking of the hearse—a doleful sound and a doleful sight.</p>

<p>In 1350 or 1351, the plague still continuing, Sir Walter Manny bought thirteen
acres of ground, adjacent to the Pardon Churchyard, and gave this to the City as a
new burial-ground; the chapel stood somewhere in Charter House Square, perhaps
about the middle of it. There used to be a stone cross in this burial-ground with
the following inscription:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Anno Domini 1349, regnante magnâ pestilentiâ, consecratum fuit hoc cœmiterium in quo et infra
septa presentis monasterii sepulta fuerunt mortuorum corpora plus quam quinquaginta millia præter alia
multa abhinc usque ad presens: quorum animabus propitietur Deus, Amen.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Charter House Precinct, to this day, whenever the ground is opened
bones are found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>Some years later Sir Walter Manny, with Michael de Northburgh, Bishop
of London, founded on the spot a House which they at first intended to be only a
College of twelve Chaplains, one of whom was to preside; they enlarged their plan,
however, and converted this college into a House of Carthusians, whose Prior
obtained a Bull of the Pope in 1362 for the acquisition of certain benefices valued at
£200 a year. Nine years later, in February 1471-72, the House obtained license
to hold twenty acres of ground for their Precinct, together with a Chapel dedicated
to the Annunciation of the Virgin. It had already received, by the will of Bishop
Michael, who died in 1361, £2000 in money, many rents and tenements, the Bishop’s
Library, and his best Vestments. The House was, further, largely endowed by
other Kings and Princes. Sir Walter Manny, who died in 1471, was buried in the
Choir of the Church.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CHARTER HOUSE<br />
From the Grangerised edition of Brayley’s <cite>London and Middlesex</cite> in Guildhall Library.</div>
</div>

<p>No House commanded greater respect than this of the Carthusians, for the
simple reason that while the Rule in other Houses was relaxed, or was scandalously
neglected, successive generations of Carthusians showed no change in their austerities
and no deviation from their Rule. They came to England about 1180, and settled
first at Witham, near Bath. Their austerities are thus described:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>
<p>“They wear nothing made from furs or linen, nor even that finely-spun linen
garment which we call Staminium; neither breeches, unless when sent on a journey,
which at their return they wash and restore. They have two tunics with cowls, but
no additional garment in winter, though, if they think fit, in summer they may lighten
their garb. They sleep clad and girded, and never after matins return to their
beds; but they so order the time of matins that it shall be light ere the lauds
begin: so intent are they on their rule, that they think no jot or tittle of it should
be disregarded. Directly after the hymns, they sing the prime, after which they go
out to work for stated hours. They complete whatever service or labour they have
to perform by day without any other light. No one is ever absent from the daily
services, or from complines, except the sick. The cellarer and hospitaller, after
complines, wait upon the guests, yet observing the strictest silence. The abbot
allows himself no indulgence beyond the others, everywhere present, everywhere
attending to his flock, except that he does not eat with the rest, because his
table is with the strangers and the poor. Nevertheless, be he where he may, he is
equally sparing of food and speech; for never more than two dishes are served to
him or to his company: lard and meat never but to the sick. From the Ides of
September till Easter, through regard for whatever festival, they do not take more
than one meal a day except on Sunday. They never leave the cloister but for
purpose of labour, nor do they ever speak, either there or elsewhere, save only
to the abbot or prior. They pay unwearied attention to the canonical services,
making no addition to them except for the defunct. They use in their divine service
the Ambrosian chants and hymns, as far as they were able to learn them at Milan.
While they bestow care on the stranger and the sick, they inflict intolerable
mortifications on their own bodies for the health of their souls.” Add to this list of
austerities that they wore a hair cloth next the skin; that they were not permitted
to buy fish, but that they might accept it; that they made bread of bran and drank
their wine diluted.</p>

<p>The House of the Salutation stood for 200 years. During that long period the
Brethren continued the same austerities; there is no record of any falling-off; they
remained all their lives within the walls of their House; all that the world knew
of them came from their servants and their visitors. Other Houses might relax,
into other Houses luxury might creep, but not with the Carthusians, they remained
true till the end. The story of the end belongs to that of the Dissolution of
Religious Houses. (See <cite>London in the Time of the Tudors</cite>.)</p>

<small>ELSYNG SPITAL</small></h3>


<p>This House, the memory of which had almost disappeared, was again restored to
Mediæval London by the publication of Dr. Sharpe’s <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>. And
since the original terms of a Religious Foundation, and the subsequent growth of a
Religious House by bequest and gift, are not often accessible, I extract from the
work (1) the précis of the original will of William de Elsing, mercer, by which
this House was created; and (2) a list, with dates, of the various gifts which from
time to time were made to the House. Here, then, is the will, dated 1348, in which
he confirms his Foundation of 1329.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Elsingg (William de) Mercer.—To Robert his son a tenement with shops and garden in the parish
of S. Botolph without Aldrichesgate, and divers rents in the parish of S. Laurence in the Jewry. All his
tenements and rents in the parishes of S. Alphege and S. Mary de Aldermanburi, together with the
appropriation of the said church of S. Mary in which tenements he had already commenced to build an
almshouse of stone and a church, he devises for the maintenance of a hospital for the poor, blind, and
indigent of both sexes, under the direction of a prior and convent; and he wills that no one else soever,
ecclesiastic or secular, except the said prior and convent and the testator’s executors after named, shall
intermeddle in the said house or hospital. And whereas the wants of the poor are too many for his
means to completely satisfy, he leaves to the said prior, &amp;c., tenements, shops, rents, &amp;c., in the parishes
of S. Laurence in the Jewry, All Hallows de Honylane, S. Martin Pomer in Ismongerelane, S. Mildred
in the Poultry, S. Giles without Crepelgate, and All Hallows de Graschirche: also in Conynghoplane in
the said parish of S. Mildred and in Cordwanerstrete in the parish of S. Mary le Bow, and in the parish of
S. Benedict atte Wodewharf and elsewhere, so that the said prior and convent for the time being maintain
chantries for the souls of Robert le Fruyter, Ralph de Holbech and Sir Geoffrey de Holbech, William de
Carleton, Bartholomew de Castello, William de Gayton, and others. Notification of the king’s licence in
mortmain for the above devises having been obtained; and also of the assent of Sir Ralph (de Stratford)
Bishop of London, the Dean and Chapter of S. Paul’s and other parties interested, to the canons of the
said Hospital being placed under the rule and order of S. Augustine, with the habit of canons regular of
the same order, and to their number being five at the least. The Dean and Chapter of S. Paul’s appointed
patrons of the said hospital and to act as wardens during a vacancy. His executors to be guardians of the
said Hospital and of all the above tenements and rents until a prior and canons shall have been duly
elected and constituted. Dated in the hospital aforesaid Monday next before the Feast of Annunciation
of V. Mary (25th March) <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1348.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hospital had been already commenced, as the Will states, on the site of
a decayed nunnery in Gayspur Lane, London Wall, for the maintenance of blind
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>The House thus founded began to attract bequests. Robert de Elsing, son of
the founder, endowed chantries for the souls of his father and others. I find thirty-two
bequests in the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> down to the year 1530, and of course these
were not all.</p>

<p>In the year 1430 a considerable accession to the property of the Hospital
occurred through the then Bishop of London transferring the estates of a decayed
House, that of Thele, Hertford, to Elsyng Spital on condition of founding two
canons on Thele and three on Elsyng to pray for the souls of certain benefactors of
Thele.</p>

<p>On the surrender of Elsyng House its annual income was returned at
£193: 15: 5.</p>

<p>The Priory was granted to Sir John Williams, afterwards Lord Williams of
Thane, and Keeper of the King’s jewels. He converted the whole into a dwelling-house
for himself; the chapel yard he made a garden; the cloisters a gallery, and
bedesmen’s rooms into stables. The house was burned down in 1541.</p>

<p>Meantime, the chapel of the Priory had been converted into the Parish Church
of St. Alphege. The old church stood on the opposite side of the road, under the
wall, like the churches of St. Augustine and All Hallows; its churchyard, on the east
of the Chapel, still remains, opposite the entrance of the modern church. The
parishioners paid the King £100 for their new church.</p>

<small>ST. BARTHOLOMEW</small></h3>


<p>The Hospital and the Priory of St. Bartholomew were distinct and separate
foundations, of which the former was governed by the latter. The traditional
history of this foundation is one of those remarkable stories which belong to a
period when things material and things imagined were mixed together, and the
visions of a brain, disordered by sickness, or by fasting, or by loneliness, were even
more real than the tangible realities of man and matter. In the time of Henry the
First there lived about the Court one Rahere, who was a knight, or a minstrel, a
gentleman, or a jester, a man of noble extraction, or of obscure origin, whichever
you please, for the histories differ. Either before or after his “conversion” Rahere
is said to have occupied the stall of Chamberlayne’s Wood at St. Paul’s. It was a
time in which there was a great deal of what modern Evangelicals used to call
“conviction of sin.” Rahere was one of those so convinced. Like many others
at that time, when a wave of religious emotion swept over the whole country,
Rahere yearned to deepen his newly found sense of religion by going on pilgrimage.
The going on pilgrimage, as a part of mediæval life, has been treated in another
place. Rahere, it is enough to say, followed the common custom of the time when
he went on pilgrimage to Rome. This was in 1120. Now, on arriving at Rome, or
on the way, he was seized with a malarious fever, insomuch that he was like to die.
He therefore prayed to St. Bartholomew, promising to found a Hospital for the
poor, should he by the help of the Saint be permitted to recover. Now the bones
of St. Bartholomew were found in India, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1113, only seven years before Rahere’s
arrival, and, being brought over to Rome, were placed on an island of the Tiber,
where had formerly stood a temple to Æsculapius. Probably Rahere had quite
recently visited this place; we remember the eagerness with which the mediæval
folk ran after every new saint, or every new discovery of relics. However that may
be, he had a Vision, in which the Saint appeared to him, and granted his recovery
on the conditions promised by the supplicant. Rahere, therefore, on his return,
proceeded to found the hospital. But the Saint appeared to him: would he do
more? Would he found also a Religious House? The spot—Smithfield, the
smooth field—was part of the fenny flat that lay north of London Wall: a barren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
heath covered with springs and ponds, and set with occasional clumps of trees.
Horse races were held here, a weekly horse fair, there were stables and grooms and
people to look after the horses, they were a rough and rude folk, living without the
jurisdiction of the City, and they had no Church nor any religious people among
them; it was the place also on which executions were held, and it was accounted
infamous. Rahere obeyed the Saint in this respect as well; he erected his hospital,
beginning the building in 1123, with the assistance of Richard de Belmeis, then
Bishop of London, and the King himself.</p>

<p>Rahere next proceeded to found the Priory of St. Bartholomew beside the
Hospital. The House received its first Charter from Henry the First in 1133. In
this Charter the King orders his successors to defend the House as jealously as
their own crown. The Priory has long since disappeared, with the exception of part
of the Church, but the Hospital exists to this day, enlarged and richly endowed,
a perennial fountain of life and health, while the church of the Priory, such part of
it as still remains, is the noblest mediæval monument left to London. The
Hospital, according to the custom of the time, consisted of a double Hall, or a single
Hall with aisles. Between the aisles, or at the end of the Hall, was the Chapel.
In either aisle were the beds of the sick: the men on one side, the women on the
other. As the patients were brought in, they were put to bed—two, four, even eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
in one bed—without any regard to the kind of disease from which they suffered, so
that in case of contagion or infection the other occupants of the bed were certain to
catch it. One wonders how, in these circumstances, any one ever came out of the
Hospital at all, and how any one could expect to recover. But all diseases were not
infectious or contagious; and as for the patient, he was probably, from long experience
of dirt and confined air, secure as regards many things which would now be fatal;
then there was food for him; there was nursing of a kind; if one were thirsty he
could drink; if one were hungry he could eat; the sisters were gentle and pitiful;
the physician was always in readiness; his remedies were strange and wonderful, but
the groundwork was the old wife’s knowledge of herbs and their uses—lore not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
be despised;—moreover, the chief terror of death was removed, because the priest
was always in the hospital with the last offices of the Church to fortify the dying.
The Hall was spacious, lofty, and well lit—a paradise to a fever-stricken wretch from
a hovel without chimney, floor, or window; the beds were soft and clean—as
cleanliness was then understood; the way of death was made easy, even if the
recovery of health were denied.</p>

<div class="caption">TOMB OF PRIOR RAHERE<br />

<p>Rahere himself became the first Prior of his monastery; he died September
20, 1144, and was buried in the Church; the canopied tomb of the fifteenth
century, which still stands in the Chancel of St. Bartholomew the Great, is said to
cover the dust of the Founder, whose effigy may be twelfth-century work. On the
tomb are figured two monks reading in Bibles open at the fifty-first chapter of Isaiah
and the third verse:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her
wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
thanksgiving and the voice of melody.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more appropriate text. There are four shields on
the tomb, being those of England, London, the Hospital, and the Priory. The tomb
itself was desecrated by workmen in 1864. One of the leather sandals was taken
off Rahere’s foot, and lost for thirty years; it has now been recovered, and is placed
with other things in a small glass case in the church.</p>

<p>Rahere joined the order of Canons Regular of St. Augustine, who were great
builders and architects, and, among other things, practised medicine.</p>

<p>Those of the original buildings which remain are small portions of the choir of
the church, from which the whole has been restored, and perhaps a portion or
fragments of the transepts. The nave has long since been destroyed; the transepts
are later. Originally there were an apsidal Lady Chapel and two apsidal side
chapels: that on the north side is dedicated to St. Bartholomew; that on the south
to St. Stephen. When Rahere died there were thirteen canons for the new Foundation,
a number increased to thirty-five under his successor. There can be no doubt,
therefore, of the success of the House. The canons were not subject to duty in the
Hospital. For the service of the sick there was another Foundation, consisting of a
Hospitaller with eight Brothers and four Sisters, under the rule of the Prior.
Rahere’s buildings were largely extended by his successor. About the same time
was built the gateway into Smithfield, which still, most fortunately, stands, having
escaped vandal, builder, landlord, and every danger. The present west front is, of
course, modern, and the churchyard occupies the site of the former nave.</p>

<p>In this Priory happened that most disgraceful scene of violence in which the
Archbishop of Canterbury, an alien of Provence, was the chief aggressor, when he
visited the Priory in defiance of the rights of the Bishop of London and replied to
remonstrance by violence. This prelate was Boniface, uncle of Queen Eleanor of
Provence, who had been brought to this country with so many of his countrymen
and preferred to the highest place that the realm had to offer (see vol. i. p. 29).</p>

<p>We have in this episode a graphic and most suggestive picture of the exasperation
caused by the admission of aliens to the offices and dignities which, above all,
required a knowledge of the country and its institutions and its prejudices. The
rights and privileges of ecclesiastics and of Religious Houses were defended with
the greatest possible jealousy and tenacity. It was clearly a privilege of this House
that their visitor was the Bishop of London, and that the Archbishop had no
right to intrude himself into the House. That he did so is proof of an attempt at
encroachment, of which an Englishman would have been incapable. But observe,
as well, the arrogance of the Prelate. He seizes the Sub-prior and hurls him
against a pillar; the Canons run to his rescue, and the Archbishop is thrown on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
back ignominiously, betraying the fact that he is armed beneath his episcopal robes.
And his men, his followers, are themselves strangers and aliens—men of Provence,
like himself.</p>

</div>

<p>It may be observed, as well, that the citizens had their own standard of
episcopal duties, if the words are correctly reported. “He is no winner of souls,”
they cry: “he is an exacter of money, whom neither God nor any lawful or free
election did bring to this promotion.” That the ideal of the people was so far above
the practice of the prelates in such cases as this shows, it might be fairly argued,
that the parish priest of Chaucer, drawn a hundred and fifty years later, existed
already in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The restored plan of the Priory is here reproduced by permission of the Rev.
Sir Borradaile Savory, Bart.</p>

<p>In 1410 the church was rebuilt “almost anew.” The apse of the east end was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
removed; a square east end terminating with two large windows was inserted; the
Norman Lady Chapel was taken down and the present one erected with a crypt;
the Norman Clerestory was taken down and replaced by the present one; the
Norman capitals were changed; the stone screen under the North Transept was
inserted, probably to give strength to the piers. A Chantry Chapel was built on
the north side of the north aisle. In wills of this period St. Katherine’s Chapel is
referred to, also a Pardon churchyard. A stone pulpit was put up in the choir.
A peal of five bells was given to the church in 1520 by one Thomas Bullesden.
This is the oldest peal in London, and the bells are dedicated respectively to St.
Bartholomew, St. Anna, St. Peter, St. Katherine, St. Johannes Baptista.</p>

<p>The last Prior but one was Bolton (1506-1522). He built the oriel window on
the south side of the Choir. His rebus of a Bolt-in-Tun is in the centre panel.
The same rebus is found in the spandril of the door leading into the Vestry Room,
and in the brickwork of Canonbury Tower, Islington, which was also built by Bolton.
This Tower, with buildings now destroyed, standing in extensive grounds, the
boundaries of which can still be made out, was apparently a summer residence of the
Canons.</p>

<p>To return to the Hospital, Rahere’s first Hospitaller was Alfune, who built
St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, also outside the walls. Alfune used to go into the shambles
every morning begging scraps and bits of meat for the sick men and women. He
had under his orders eight Brothers of the Hospital, who were priests as well as
physicians, and four sisters.</p>

<p>A representation of a mediæval hospital shows the double hall, the priest is
administering the last rites of the Church to one patient, the sisters are sewing up
the body of another just dead, mass is being sung at the altar, a visitor is kneeling
in prayer. Such is Rahere’s first hospital, such was every mediæval hospital.</p>

<p>Little is recorded of the Hospital between the Foundation and the Dissolution.
In the reign of Henry the Third one Katherine, widow of William Hardell, obtained
a grant of a small plot of ground, twenty feet each way, for the purpose of building
an anchorite’s cell next to the “chapel of St. Bartholomew”—was that the chapel of
the Hospital or the stately church of the Priory? It was the special duty of the
anchorite to pray for the prosperity of the House and for the souls of those within
it. Perhaps he may have prayed for both Hospital and Priory. In the reign of
Edward the Third the Hospital was “confirmed” by the King. In the year 1423
Whittington’s executors repaired the buildings; and in the same year we learn that
the Hospital possessed a library, because Sir John Wakening, once a priest in the
House, enriched their library by the gift of a beautiful Bible.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Collections of a London Citizen</cite><a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> is the following notice of the
Hospital:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Bartholomew ys Spetylle. Hyt ys aplace of grete comforte to pore men as

</div>

<p>Referring to the very copious notes in my hands, I make the following additions
to the history which precedes:—</p>

<p>The Charter of Henry the First, 1133, granting the Foundation of the Priory,
and addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to Gilbert the Universal,
Bishop of London, was printed in 1891 by Dr. Norman Moore from the copy in the
Record Office. The reader desirous of more detailed information on this House
is also referred to Dr. Norman Moore’s work on the Church of St. Bartholomew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Great. There is a great quantity of literature on the subject of this House. The
following list is by no means exhaustive, but it will serve:—Papers may be consulted
in the <cite>Vetusta Monumenta</cite>, vol. ii.; in the <cite>Transactions of St. Paul’s Eccl. Soc.</cite>
vol. ii.; <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vols. xv. and xix.; <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>—see Indices; the
<cite>Antiquary</cite>—see Indices; the <cite>Reliquary</cite>—see Indices; the <cite>L. and Midd. Arch.
Soc.</cite> vols. i., ii., iii.; <cite>Journal of Brit. Architects</cite>, i., xxx., xli.; <cite>Archæolog. Journal</cite>,
vols. xli. and xlviii.</p>

<p>In 1362 we find a dispute between the Canons of the Priory and the Brethren
of the Hospital concerning the list of the sick. In 1433 the Bishop of London
issues ordinances for the better management of the Priory. Another dispute
between the Priory and certain persons in the Diocese of Lincoln was thought
important enough to demand a Papal commission, the Commissioners being the
Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, to decide upon it. The Prior and Canons complained
in 1310 of the offal thrown out into the Fleet at Holborn Bridge. They
succeeded in getting an Ordinance, but as to its enforcement history is mute.
We find them, later on, petitioning against the making of holes and ditches in
Smithfield—the petition, referring to some temporary grievance, shows that the
Priory considered itself as in some sort the guardian of Smithfield. It seems, since
the claim is set up in other cases, to have been a custom, in the election of a new
Prior, to grant a Pension to one of the King’s clerks. John de Herclaston, clerk,
in 1316, addresses a letter to the Prior and Canons claiming such a pension by right
of custom. In the same year a certain Nicholas de la Marche begs the Prior to admit
him into their House, “because he is an old servant of the King and infirm.”
In 1530 we find that one Thomas Cornwall, convicted of heresy, who had been
condemned to wear a faggot broidered on his sleeve—a pleasing reminder of
orthodoxy—was sent to perpetual custody in the House of St. Bartholomew for
disobeying the sentence. The story opens up a large field for hopeless inquiry.
How many prisoners for heresy were there in the Houses at the time of the Dissolution?
Were they all permitted to go at large? Is there any evidence as to the
subsequent history of any of them? As regards Thomas Cornwall, if he was placed
“in penance,” <i>i.e.</i> on bread and water, in a solitary cell, he did not, probably, survive
to see the Dissolution of his Prison. On the other hand, if he did, it is not very
likely that he saw his own private heresy any the nearer to becoming the creed of
the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Of St. Bartholomew’s Fair an account will be found in another place. (See
<cite>London in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, p. 465 <cite>et seq.</cite>)</p>

<p>On October 25, 1540, Fuller, the last Prior, surrendered the House. The
revenue was then £773: 0: 1-1/2; the net income was £693: 0: 10-3/4. The nave
was destroyed, and the stones were used by the King for other buildings.</p>

<p>The Priory buildings, consisting of the Prior’s house, the Infirmary, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Dormitory, the Refectory, the cloisters, kitchens, stables, and gardens, were sold to Sir
Richard Rich for £1064. The site of the nave, eighty-seven feet in length, became
a churchyard, and the choir became a Parish Church. The King appointed the first
Rector, after which the patronage belonged to Sir Richard Rich as his successor.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Rich, as Lord Chancellor, presided at the trial of Anne Askew, and,
according to report, assisted with his own hands in her torture. He was also
present at her execution.</p>

<p>In 1516 Queen Mary gave the Priory to the Black Friars, who lived here until
their expulsion in 1559 by Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In <cite>Londina Illustrata</cite> it is said that the old Parish Church adjoined the Priory
Church; that when the Black Friars were turned out, the Priory Church, together
with the old Parish Church, was made the Parish Church. In that case the old
Parish Church must have been part of the structure of the Priory Church. The
account is confused, because the writer goes on to relate that the old Parish Church
was pulled down, except the steeple of wood, which became ruinous, and was taken
down in 1628, the present tower being then erected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>The Great Fire was happily stopped before it could cross Smithfield.</p>

<p>In 1697 Hogarth was baptized in this church.</p>

<p>In 1863 Restoration was begun. The Lady Chapel had been converted
first into a dwelling-house and next into a fringe manufactory; part of the factory
projected into the church, and was supported by an iron girder and two iron
columns. In the north Transept was a blacksmith’s forge; in the south the boys’
school.</p>

<p>The following is an account of the most interesting Restoration—may one who
is no architect be permitted to say the most valuable?—as set forth in the papers
prepared for the reopening of the Lady Chapel on May 18, 1897:—</p>

<p>At the commencement of the Restoration in 1863, the floor was lowered to its
original level, the pews removed, a dry area formed round the outside of the
Church, and the walls and piers, which had perished, were made good. The Apse
was also completed on the ground-floor level by the insertion of the two central
piers, the storey above being occupied by a fringe manufactory. Some £5000 in all
was collected and expended. (Late Rev. J. Abbiss, M.A., Rector.)</p>

<p>In 1884-86 the Fringe Factory, which projected twenty feet into the east end of
the Church, and which covered the remains of the Crypt and Lady Chapel, was
purchased for £6500.</p>

<p>The Apse was restored at the sole charge of the Patron, the Rev. Canon
Phillips. The Church was re-roofed.</p>

<p>The Blacksmith’s Forge, occupying the site of the North Transept, was
purchased. The restored portions were reopened on November 30, 1886. (Late
Rev. W. Panckridge, M.A., Rector.)</p>

<p>In 1887-92 the South Transept.—The temporary Vestry, which occupied the
upper portion of the South Transept Arch, was removed. The Norman Arch on the
north side, and the Transition Norman Arch on the south side, were uncovered and
brought to light, together with much other work of considerable interest. One bay
was added to provide a Baptistery, and to form a suitable approach on the south
side of the Church. The Transept now covers about half of the site of the original
Transept. It was opened on March 14, 1891.</p>

<p>The Boys’ School was removed from the North Triforium, and new Schools
were built adjoining the Church. A Working Men’s Club was built beneath the
Schools, at the sole charge of the Rector.</p>

<p>A Memorial Screen was erected beneath the Organ Loft to the late Rector,
the Rev. Wm. Panckridge, M.A.</p>

<p>In 1892-93 the north Transept—the Blacksmith’s Forge—was removed, and a
shallow Transept rebuilt, giving abutment to the great arches of the Crossing, and
providing a Morning chapel, and uncovering much old work. This Transept was
opened on June 5, 1893.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p>A north Porch was built, giving access to the Church from Cloth Fair, and
providing a room for the Mission Worker.</p>

<p>A west Porch was built with a room over. The west Front was newly faced
with flint and stone, and the approach widened.</p>

<p>A new Pulpit was erected, the gift of the late Sextoness.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A new Organ Case was erected, the gift of Mr. Henry Thomas Withers, in
memory of his brother, the late Frederick John Withers.</p>

<p>The north and south Triforia were opened out. The Peal of Bells was re-hung,
and the Bell Tower repaired.</p>

<p>In 1895 the Crypt was restored and reopened as a Mortuary Chapel.</p>

<p>In 1897 the Lady Chapel was restored, and was opened as a Morning Chapel
by the Bishop of London on May 18, 1897.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Mr. (now Sir) Aston Webb, the Architect in charge of the Work, was
guided throughout by the sound principles: (1) never to remove from its position
any worked stone.</p>

<p>(2) To add no new work except such as is necessitated by the requirements of
the day.</p>

<p>(3) To make new work harmonise with the old, but to differentiate it so that
those who come after may never mistake the work of any one century for that
of any other.</p>

<p>And, finally, to bear in mind the direction contained in Rahere’s Vision—“Having
in Him trust, do thou of the cost of the building doubt thee nought, only
give thy diligence, and my part shall be to provide the necessaries, direct, build, and
complete the work.” (Rev. Sir Borradaile Savory, Bart., M.A., Rector.)</p>

<p><em>The Hospital of Saint Bartholomew’s</em>, when it was suppressed, at the same time
was valued at a yearly revenue of £35: 5: 7. We make an observation on this
hospital similar to that suggested by St. Mary’s Spital. How could the House,
we ask, consisting of a Master, eight brethren, and four sisters, be kept on £35: 5: 7
a year? and on what funds were the sick people received and treated? There
must have been some organised method of getting subscriptions, donations, alms,
and gifts in kind. The story of what happened when the place was taken over by
the City shows that voluntary and organised help for the sick was surely no new
thing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>
<p>“Then also were orders devised for the relief of the poor, the inhabitants were
all called to their parish churches, where by Sir Richard Dobbes, then Mayor, their
several aldermen, or other grave citizens, they were by eloquent orations persuaded
how great and how many commodities would ensue unto them and their City if the
poor of divers sorts, which they named, were taken from out their streets, lanes, and
alleys, and were bestowed and provided for in hospitals abroad, etc. Therefore was
every man moved liberally to grant, what they would impart towards the preparing
and furnishing of such hospitals, and also what they would contribute weekly
towards their maintenance for a time, which they said should not be past one year,
or twain, until they were better furnished of endowment: to make short, ever many
granted liberally, according to his ability: books were drawn of the relief in every
ward of the city towards the new hospitals.”</p>

<small>ST. THOMAS OF ACON</small></h3>


<p>A Foundation of very human interest was the Hospital of St. Thomas of Acon or
St. Thomas of Acres. It is well known that Thomas Becket belonged to a wealthy
city family, his father having been a citizen of Norman extraction. Gilbert Becket
died leaving behind him a considerable property
in houses and lands. Whether the
Archbishop took possession of this property
as his father’s son, or whether he gave it to
his sister, I do not know. Certain it is that,
after his death, his sister Agnes, married to
Thomas FitzTheobald de Heiley, gave the
whole of the family estates to endow a Hospital
dedicated to her brother, Saint and
Martyr. Nothing should be kept back, all
must be given; one sees the intensity of
affection, sorrow, pride, with which the new
saint was regarded by his family. There
are no churchwomen so zealous as the
daughters of the Bishop; there could be no
worshippers at the altar of St. Thomas à Becket more devout than his own sister.</p>

<div class="caption">SEAL OF THE HOSPITAL<br />OF ST. THOMAS OF ACON<br />
From John Watney’s <cite>Some Account of<br />the Hospital of
St. Thomas of Acon</cite>.</div>
</div>

<p>The full title of the House was “To the Honour of Almighty God and the
Blessed Virgin and the most Glorious Martyr St. Thomas, for a Master and
Brethren Militiæ Hospitalis S. Thomæ Martyris Cantuariensis de Acon.”</p>

<p>Newcourt gives two explanations for this dedication and the name of Acon:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Radulphus de Diceto, Dean of London, who in his History, intituled, Imagines Historiarum, living
Ann. Dom. 1190, ann. 2 Ric. I., when the City of Acres or Acon in the Holy-land (call’d also Ptolemais)
was besieg’d by the Christians, writes as follows; About these Days, when the City of Acon was first
besieg’d, one William, an English-Man by Nation, being Chaplain to Radulphus de Diceto, Dean of
London, when he went to Jerusalem, bound himself by a Vow, that if he should prosperously enter Acon,
he would build a Chapel to S. Thomas the Martyr, at his own Charge, according to his Ability, and would
procure there, to the Honour of the said Martyr, a Churchyard to be consecrated, which was done.
Then many flocking from all parts to serve in this Chappel, William himself as a Token of his Christianity,
took on him the Name of Prior, who, whilst he serv’d Bodily as a Souldier of Christ, had an especial Care
of the Poor, and he freely bestow’d all his Diligence and Labour, in Burying of the Bodies of such as died,
as well naturally, as of others who were slain with the Sword, representing himself in Mans sight, the next
Successor of that great Tobias.</p>

<p>My other testimony (saith he) is out of the Theatre of Honour, Lib. 9, cap. ii., where, repeating
the Military Orders of the Holy Land, he saith thus, The Order of S. Thomas was instituted by the King
of England, Richard, surnamed Cœur de Lyon, after the surprizal of Acres, and being of the English
Nation, they held the Rule of S. Augustine, wore a white Habit, and a full red Cross, charged in the
middle with a white Scallop, they took for their Patron (as I have heard) the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Metropolitan of England, Thomas Becket, who suffer’d Martyrdom (as his Favourers say) under the
King of England, Hen. II. of that Name. Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester, who had been five
years in the Holy Land, removed the Church there of S. Thomas the Martyr, from an unfit place to a
more convenient, and caused the Patriarch of Jerusalem to take Order, that the Brethren of this Church
who were before, Lay-men, might be under the Order of the Temples, wearing a Cross on their Breast.
He bequeathed also to this House of St. Thomas of Acon 500 Marks. So much M. Paris in vita Hen. III.
p. 472, sub Anno 1238.</p>

<p>Hereby it is clear, that the Dedication of this Hospital or Chapel to S. Thomas of Acres or Acon,
must have relation to the like Dedication of the Chapel and Holy Order in the City of Acre, in the Holy
Land, to the same Archbishop: All these three Dedications being near about one and the same time
within few years after the Archbishop’s Death. And it is probable that in Imitation of those Dedications
at Acres, this in London might do the like.” (Newcourt’s <cite>Repertorium</cite>, vol. i. pp. 552-553.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in the year 1171 that Becket’s sister founded the Hospital. It extended
at first from Ironmonger Lane to the Old Jewry; later on, the Society bought
gardens on the other side of Old Jewry and obtained permission to erect a gallery of
communication across the street, so as to get access to their garden. It was from
the gallery that Henry the Eighth beheld the Marching Watch (see <cite>London in the
Time of the Tudors</cite>, p. 262). The buildings included a Chancel and Chapel of SS.
Stephen and Nicholas. Over the gateway (which is now the entrance of Mercers’
Hall) was a statue of the Saint. This figure which was “newly sette up of late”—(Mar.
14, 1554)—“over ye dore of Sent Thomas of Acon was shamefully mangled:
ye hedde and ye right arm being cleane stryken of, ye which Image once before
this time had the hedde lykewyse stryken off and was afterwards newly set up and
newe eftsoones broken.” Protestant zeal once more attacked this unlucky image.
It was in the reign of Elizabeth that some fiery enthusiast destroyed it, and in its
place substituted a paper of rebuke on the worship of Saints.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It was quite right and natural that, before the Protestant fury against saint
worship, or the intercession of Saints, the people of London should entertain a
profound belief in the protection extended to them by their own Saint—one whose
name and fame were spread over the whole of Christendom—for instance, refer
to the family history of Arnold FitzThedmar (p. 67). Thomas Becket was
without any doubt a citizen, and the son of a citizen—even, at the outset, intended
for the mercantile life. The Saint, quite early in his beatitude, listened benignantly
to the prayers of William, afterwards the Leader with the long Beard, and guided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
him and his friends safe to port and to victory. Such a story spread, naturally, in
all directions. It was the greatest honour for the City to possess such a Saint;
every day the pride in St. Thomas grew and was increased by reports and rumours
of miracles wrought in answer to the prayers of pilgrims.</p>

<p>There was another reason why St. Thomas became the tutelary Saint of
London. The Mediæval enthusiasm over their Saints was liable to wane and fade
away, and even to vanish. The old Saxon Saints—where were they? The shrine of
St. Erkenwald still blazed with golden vessels and tapers of wax, but miracles
were rare: there were still churches dedicated to St. Ethelburga, St. Osyth,
St. Swithin, not to speak of the Danes, St. Olaf and St. Magnus, but no one looked
any longer for miracles. As the faded images in a fifteenth-century rood screen now
appear to the modern ecclesiologist, so the figures of their Saxon saints in the
thirteenth century had become mere <i lang="la">umbræ</i>, shadows of the past. The shrine of
Edward the Confessor was still splendid, but the King’s miracles were no longer, so
to speak, quoted by the pilgrims and the miracle-mongers. The city wanted a new
Saint. Heaven gave them one—all their own—in Thomas of Chepe.</p>

<p>Therefore, on the day when the Lord Mayor was sworn at the Exchequer, he
repaired to the chapel of St. Thomas Acon with the Aldermen; after prayer and
praise at his altar, they formed a procession and thence marched to St. Paul’s, where
they went to the Pardon Churchyard in the precinct of St. Paul’s, where were buried
Gilbert Becket and his wife; and thence they marched back to St. Thomas Acon,
where every one offered a penny.</p>

<p>Let us consider how such a Foundation as this, not one of the richest, yet always
a prosperous House, was enriched and maintained. In the first place, the original
endowment was ample, if not plentiful, for the expenses of a modest number of
Brethren. But the bequests of grateful or penitent or pious citizens speedily began
to pour in. During the three hundred and fifty years of its existence, there never
quite ceased, though the violence diminished, a continual stream of gifts. Thus,
during the period from 1262 to 1535 (Sharpe’s <cite>Wills</cite>), about forty perpetual chantries
were founded. These bequests show the affection of the citizens for their Saint.
But there were greater and more important gifts. Henry the Third, Edward the
First, Geoffrey FitzPeter, the Earl of Essex, Edward the Third, Henry the Sixth,
were all benefactors to this Hospital. The Mayor and Commonalty were visitors of
the House; the Mercers’ Company, on a vacancy in the Mastership, had the right
to nominate two or three of the Convent, from whom the brethren were to choose
their master.</p>

<p>Between the Hospital and the street, Sir John Allen, Mercer and Mayor in
1525, built a very beautiful Chapel, and on his death in 1544 was buried in it. Over
the Chapel was a Hall—Newcourt says the Mercers’ Hall. The Chapel was clearly
along the line of the street—if the north side of Chepe was yet in alignment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>—
because, some years after the Dissolution, the body and tomb of Sir John Allen
were removed to the Church itself, and the Chapel was divided into shops, and so
let out for rent; after the Fire, which consumed the whole, the shops were rebuilt
on the same site.</p>

<p>Among the names of those who were buried in this church, we find those of
the Butlers—Earls of Ormond; Cavendish, of the fourteenth century; Frowyk;
Leigh; and many others. The church is said to have been a “large and noble
structure, consisting of a choir and the body of a church with side aisles.”
(Newcourt.)</p>

<p>The House was surrendered in 1539, the last master being one Lawrence
Gospeller, who received a pension of £66: 13: 4. The annual income was
estimated at £277: 3: 4. Through the offices of Sir Richard Gresham, the
Mercers purchased the site and opened the church again in 1541 as the Mercers’
Chapel. Here was kept a Free Grammar School, removed after the Fire to the
site of St. Mary Colechurch.</p>

<small>ST. ANTHONY’S</small></h3>


<p>The Hospital of St. Anthony stood in Threadneedle Street, exactly opposite Finch
Lane. It was originally a cell to the House of St. Anthony in Vienne, and was
founded as such in the reign of Henry the Third. According to Stow, the Jews
had built a synagogue there, which was taken from them and converted into a
church dedicated to the Virgin. This church became the Chapel of the Hospital.
The House consisted of a master, two priests—afterwards enlarged to fourteen,—and
twelve poor men. To the ground thus occupied there was afterwards added
a Messuage, with a garden which, under the mastership of John Carpenter (1441),
was made into a school and an almshouse. The school received from Henry the
Sixth certain manors for the maintenance of five poor scholars at Oxford, allowing
ten pence a week for every scholar. This, making allowance for the present value
of money, would not mean more than ten shillings a week, which would make a very
bare subsistence for a young and hungry student. The general stipend of a
chantry priest, which, I suppose, was the lowest form of preferment, was £6 a year,
or about 28d. a week.</p>

<p>Henry the Fifth, in the suppression of alien Houses, gave this House its
independence. In the year 1474 Edward the Fourth granted the House the same
establishment as that of St. Anthony of Vienne, and in 1485 the House was annexed
to, and incorporated with, the College of St. George of Windsor. Other gifts and
bequests fell to the Society of St. Anthony’s. In 1411 one John Sauvage, desiring
to be buried in the church of St. Anthony, and before the altar of St. Katherine,
left all his lands and tenements to the Master and Brethren of the Hospital, with
the usual conditions as to observing his obit. In 1435 Thomas Knolles, grocer,
bequeathed to Friar John Snell, warden, preceptor, or Master of the House of
St. Anthony, a shop in the parish of St. Benedict Fynk for the maintenance of a
lamp to burn in the chancel of the church of the said House, and for the observance
of the obit—not of himself, but of the said warden; a great, and perhaps unique,
mark of friendship thus to provide for a friend’s safe and speedy passage through
purgatory, rather than his own. In 1484 William Wyse, barber, left his brewery,
“le coupe super le Hoop,” in the parish of Allhallows-in-the-Wall, in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
maintain a clerk to instruct the children of St. Anthony’s in singing to music (<i lang="la">in
cantico organico</i>) and in plain chant (<i lang="la">in plano cantico</i>), and to provide for special
prayers on behalf of John Carpenter, Bishop of Worcester, the first Master of the
School, with the Collect, “Rege quæsumus, Domine, famulum tuum” while he lives,
and upon his death, that beginning “Deus qui inter apostolos.”</p>

<p>A curious privilege is recorded of this House. When the Inspectors of
Markets found a pig that was unfit for food, as being too lean, or too old, or from
any other cause not proper to be killed, they marked it as such by slitting the
animal’s ears. Then the Proctors of St. Anthony’s took possession of the creature,
and tied a bill round its neck to denote their ownership. These pigs, and no others,
were allowed to run about the streets, and to feed on what they could find, or what
was given them. If they grew fat and well, they were killed for the use of the
Hospital. But no one ventured to touch them. “But,” says Stow, “if any one
gave them bread, they would keep watch for, and daily follow, these donors,
whining till they had something given them.” Whereupon was raised a Proverb,
“Such an one will follow such an one and whine as it were an Anthony Pig.”</p>

<p>The school was at one time equal in reputation to that of St. Paul, and turned
out as many scholars and Bishops—among them Sir Thomas More, Archbishop
Heath, and Archbishop Whitgift. It fell into decay after the annexation to St.
George’s, Windsor. One Johnson, a Prebendary of Windsor, and Master of St.
Anthony’s, seems to have taken advantage of his position to ruin the House.
He turned out the bedesmen, dissolved the choir, conveyed away the plate, and
sold the bells. Then the school speedily fell into decay.</p>

<p>Once a year—on the 15th of September,—while the school was flourishing,
the boys marched in procession from Mile End along Aldgate, down Cornhill to
Stocks Market, and thence to Austin Friars, with flags flying and drums beating.</p>

<p>After the Dissolution the church was given to the Walloons, or French
Protestants, who kept it, having rebuilt it after the Fire, to recent times.</p>

<p>The school, which was not closed in 1561, was carried on as a Parish Grammar
School until the Great Fire destroyed it. Afterwards it was not rebuilt.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to note that the Dissolution of the Houses did not deprive the
scholars or the bedesmen of their endowments. In the year 1565 the collector of the
rents of the House of St. Anthony shows in his accounts the sum of £17, devoted
to the instruction of the scholars in grammar, and £31: 4s. for the stipends of
twelve poor persons for one year at the weekly charge of 1s. for each. Also 2s. was
paid, as usual, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> “le skavinger.”</p>

<small>THE PRIORY OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM</small></h3>


<p>The history of this House belongs to the history of the Knights of St. John, or
Knights Hospitallers. The Order was founded about the year 1048, beginning,
like all great orders, in a small and humble way, with a Hospital for pilgrims at
Jerusalem; after the conquest of the city, the Brethren were incorporated into a
religious body, bound by vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience; in the year 1118
they became a military body, sworn to defend the Holy Sepulchre. They became, in
the course of two centuries, an extremely wealthy body, whose only rivals were the
Templars. They wore a red surcoat over their armour, with a Maltese Cross
enamelled white and edged with gold for a badge. Their motto was “Pro fide,”
with the later addition of “Pro utilitate hominum.”</p>

<p>There were nearly 40,000 knights scattered over the various Priories,
Commanderies, and Preceptories of the Order; they were divided into eight
“langues”—Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon, England, Germany, and
Castile.</p>

<p>The Grand Prior of Clerkenwell ranked as the first Baron of England; he had
absolute authority over the English branch; after the suppression of the Templars
the Hospitallers obtained a nominal grant of all their estates, but these were so
heavily burdened with legal and other charges, that the new owners were not greatly
enriched.</p>

<p>The church of the Priory was dedicated by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem,
in 1185. The English branch of the knights grew and prospered; they acquired
a great number of manors; they sent abroad companies and contingents wherever
fighting was going on against the Moslem; no one could accuse the knights of
refusing to act up to their vows as regards fighting. But they became most
unpopular; they acquired the reputation, like the Templars, of being oppressive landlords
and proud neighbours. In the rising of Wat Tyler, vengeance fell especially
upon the Knights Hospitallers. The mob attacked, seized, wrecked, and fired the
Priory; they would not allow any effort to stay the flames; they watched it burn
for a week; and they destroyed the Prior’s house at Highbury.</p>

<p>When the insurrection was quelled, the knights returned to their ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Priory and set themselves to rebuild it in greater magnificence; the rebuilding,
conducted in the leisurely mediæval fashion, took nearly two hundred years; it was
not until 1504 that the House was completed by Sir Thomas Docwra, then Prior,
and this was only one short generation before the suppression of the Order in
England and the confiscation of their property.</p>

<p>The Dissolution of the Order took place in 1540. The Act for its suppression
was read for the first time in the House of Commons on the 22nd of April, for
the second time on the 26th, and for the third time on the 29th. On the 7th May
the Order was suppressed. The value of its revenues in England was estimated,
according to Stow, at £3385: 19: 8; according to Dugdale, at £2385: 12: 8. The
last Prior, Sir William Weston, received from the King the promise of a pension
of £1000 a year—an enormous pension considering the value of money. But he
died on the day of the suppression.</p>

<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.
</div>
</div>

<p>Unlike many Houses, the Priory, with its noble church, escaped the hands of
the destroyer for some time. What happened to it is told by Stow:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This Priory church and House of St. John was preserved from spoil or downpulling, so long as
King Henry VIII. reigned, and was employed as a store-house for the King’s toils and tents, for hunting,
and for the wars, etc.; but in the 3rd of King Edward VI., the church, for the most part, to wit, the body
and side aisles, with the great bell tower (a most curious piece of workmanship, graven gilt, and
enamelled, to the great beautifying of the city, and passing all other that I have seen), was undermined
and blown up with gunpowder; the stone thereof was employed in building of the Lord Protector’s
house in the Strand. That part of the choir which remaineth, with some side chapels, was, by Cardinal
Pole in the reign of Queen Mary, closed up at the west end, and otherwise repaired; and Sir Thomas
Gresham, knight, was then made lord prior there, with restitution of some lands, but the same was
again suppressed in the first year of Queen Elizabeth.” (<cite>Survey</cite>, vol. ii.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Not even the Templars, at their highest point of splendour, outdid these
knights in magnificence and luxury, in pride and in independence. Unpopular as
they were, they did not incur the same odium as the Templars. In their pride and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
their privileges, it is true, they were the equals of the rival Order; they were as
hard landlords; but they had this great superiority over the Templars in the fact
that they did honestly continue the work for which they were founded: they fought
the Moslem without intermission at Acre, at Rhodes, at Cyprus, at Malta, and in
the Mediterranean Sea. They preserved the respect of the world for unconquerable
courage.</p>

<p>In 1191 the Knights Hospitallers took Acre, which they held till 1292. On
losing this, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land, they retired to Cyprus,
where they lay quiet, maturing their plans for fourteen years. It was, no doubt, the
knowledge that they were forming plans for another attack on the Saracens which
saved them on the downfall of the Templars. In 1308 they conquered Rhodes,
which they defended for more than two hundred years. In 1522 they were turned
out of this island; the few knights who survived sailed away with about 4000
soldiers and others from Rhodes, and took refuge in Candia, in Sicily, and in
Naples, hoping for assistance to retake Rhodes. This assistance was not forthcoming,
but they accepted from Charles the Fifth the islands of Malta and Gozo,
to which they repaired, with all their archives and relics, in 1530. For two
hundred and fifty years after this, the knights continued to fight Turk, Algerine,
and Moor in the Mediterranean. In 1798, however, they allowed Napoleon to
land without striking a blow.</p>

<p>Their rules were so stringent that it would seem, at first, wonderful how so
much pride and luxury should have crept in. But the history of every Monastic
House shows how rules can be evaded, or so obeyed as to destroy the spirit while
adhering to the letter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>
<p>“Poverty, chastity, and obedience: to expect but bread and water and a coarse
garment. The clerks to serve in white surplices at the altar. The priests, in
their surplices, to convey the Host to the sick, with a deacon or clerk preceding them,
bearing a lantern and the sponge filled with holy water. The brethren to go abroad
by appointment of the master, but never singly, and to avoid giving offence. No
females to be employed for or about their persons; when soliciting alms, to visit
churches or people of reputation, and ask their food for charity; if they received
none, to buy enough for subsistence; to account for all their receipts to the
master, and he to give them to the poor, retaining only one-third part of provisions,
the overplus to the poor. The brethren to go soliciting only by permission; to
carry candles with them; to wear no skins of wild beasts, or clothes degrading the
Order. To eat but twice a day on Wednesday and Saturday; and no flesh from
Septuagesima till Easter, except when aged or indisposed. To sleep covered.
If incontinent in private, to repent in privacy, and do penance; if the brother
was discovered, he was to be deprived of his robe in the church of the town after
mass, to be severely whipped, and expelled from the Order; but, if truly
penitent, he might be again received; but not without penance and a year’s
expulsion, etc.”</p>

<div class="caption">CRYPT OF ST. JOHN’S CHURCH, CLERKENWELL</div>
</div>

<p>If we follow the fortunes of the House after the accession of Elizabeth, we find
that the south gate was granted by King James in 1604 to Sir Roger Wilbraham for
life. In 1607 the site of the House, containing five acres, was granted to Ralph
Freeman and his heirs. The choir, which had been restored or rebuilt by Cardinal
Pole, became the property of Sir William Cecil; the Earl of Elgin got it by his
marriage with Diana, daughter of the Earl of Exeter; his son, being created Earl
of Aylesbury, called it Aylesbury Chapel. In the reign of James the Second a
Roman Catholic convent of Benedictine monks was set up in the Precinct of
St. John’s. An account of the attempt is given in T. Cromwell’s <cite>History of
Clerkenwell</cite>:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“It appears, that in the reign spoken of, a certain <i>Father Corker</i> was ‘resident in England to the
Elector of Colen’ (Cologne); and that, having first set up a chapel in the Savoy, from which, owing to a
dispute with the Jesuits, he was persuaded by the King to remove, ‘he went to St. John’s, corruptly called
St. Jone’s, and there built a mighty pretty convent, which the Revolution of 1688 pulled down to the
ground, to his very great loss, for as he was Dean of the rosary, he melted down the great gold chalice and
patten to help towards this building, supplying the want of them with one of silver just of that make. He
counted this convent for the conversion of souls amongst those things which the holy Fathers of the
Church allow the church treasure to be spent on.’ This convent seems to have cost the Benedictines
considerable sums of money; frequent entries appear in their account-books of that period of amounts
paid towards its erection, etc. It is always styled in these books ‘The Factory,’ or, ‘The Factory in
Clerkenwell.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the year 1721 the estate was purchased by Simon Michell, and in 1723 he
repaired and enlarged the chapel, which he sold to the commissioners for building
fifty new churches, for £2950. The church was declared to be a parish church, and
the parish assigned to it was the former precinct of the Priory.</p>

<p>The remains of the Priory consist now of the gate, the crypt of the church,
some fragments of the ancient walls, and foundations of the former buildings. The
crypt, which, until recently, was filled with coffins, has now been cleared; it is one
of the most remarkable monuments in London; it was found by excavation to have
extended, formerly, much farther to the west; probably to the whole extent of the
church.</p>

<p>The Gatehouse consists of the gate itself, with two rooms, one on each side,
and a large chamber above. In 1731 it was occupied by Edward Cave the publisher,
and from this spot was issued the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>. The associations of
Johnson, Goldsmith, and others with the Gate belong to another place.</p>

<p>The Gatehouse served for some time as a tavern. In 1876 it became the
Chapter House of the English Order of St. John of Jerusalem.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Templars</span></p>

<p>We now turn to the second of the two great Military Orders which belong
to the Mediæval Life. The Templar, as well as the Knight Hospitaller, rode
through the streets with his following, haughty, rich, luxurious, hated by the
people as a hard and cruel landlord; hated by the King for his privileges; by
the Church as outside Episcopal jurisdiction; by the City for his pride, and for the
vices which were freely attributed to him.</p>

<p>The story of the destruction of the Order of Knights Templars in 1306-1312
is a historical problem that will never, I suppose, be satisfactorily explained.
The broad facts are well known. In the year 1305, through the influence of
Philippe le Bel, King of France, Bertrand, Archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected
Pope and took the title of Clement the Fifth. He was the first of the Popes of
Avignon. In return for the tiara, Clement undertook to perform certain acts, in
number six. Five of them are known. The sixth, kept a secret, is supposed to
have been the suppression of the Templars. There were indeed various reasons
why the King—or any king in Western Europe—should desire the suppression of
this Order. The knights had grown enormously rich; some idea of their wealth
may be obtained by the enumeration of some of the manors they possessed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
England alone. Let us take one county, Hertfordshire (C. G. Addison’s <cite>Knights
Templars</cite>, p. 94). In this county formerly they possessed the town and forest
of Broxbourne, the manor of Chelsin Templars (Chelsin Templariorum) and the
manors of Laugenok, Broxbourne, Letchworth, and Temple Dynnesley; demesne
lands at Stanho, Preston, Charlton, Walden, Hiche Chelles, Levecamp and Benigho;
the church of Broxbourne, two watermills, and a lock on the river Lea; property
at Hichen, Pyrton, Ickilford, Offeley Parva, Walden Regis, Furnivale, Ipolitz,
Wandsmyll, Watton, Therleton, Weston, Gravele, Wilien, Leccheworth, Baldock,
Datheworth, Russenden, Codpeth, Sumershale, Buntynford, etc., and the church of
Weston.</p>

</div>

<p>It must not be supposed that Hertfordshire was exceptional in this respect; the
whole of England was dotted over with the possessions of the Order. All this land
was given to the Order at a time when the first passion for crusading had cooled,
and princes began to think that it might be better for the country if men were paid
to fight the Saracen. The Templars were at first a very fine regiment, splendidly
equipped, and full of valour. To maintain this regiment was surely a good work,
almost as good as going to fight in person. The land was given them on the
condition that the larger part of the revenues should be sent every year to the
Grand Master of the House and Order in Jerusalem. It was held by them, further,
on such terms as were never before heard of; the knights were exempt from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
taxation aids and “amerciaments”; they could not be compelled to plead except
before the King or his Chief Justice; they had power to hold Courts; to impose
fines upon their tenants; to hold markets; to try criminals caught on their lands;
they could travel without paying toll; they were not obliged to
contribute to bridges and other works; they seized the chattels
of all felons caught on their lands. Nor was this all: they
were exempted from paying tithe; they could not be excommunicated
by Bishop or priest; their houses had the right of
sanctuary; and they had an Ecclesiastical Court of their own,
with a judge, whom they called Conservator Privilegiorum
Suorum. The Grand Master and the Brotherhood were
subordinate only to the Pope; a large number of priests had
been admitted to the Order, which was entirely free from the
Church in any country. This great Order, at the beginning
of the fourteenth century, numbered, it is said, fifteen hundred
knights, with chaplains and serving brothers innumerable. The
revenues were, as has been shown, enormous, and not one penny
went to the purpose for which the Order had been endowed.
The Holy Land had been swept clear of Christians; the Latin
Kingdom, the name of which survived, had been destroyed for more than a hundred
years; the degenerate grandsons of the Crusaders had long been scattered to the
four winds; the Knights Templars and Knights Hospitallers
had been expelled from the country, even from the fortified ports:
Jaffa and Antioch fell in 1268, Tripoli in 1290, Acre in 1291.
Then the Templars, reduced in numbers, retired to Cyprus,
whence, in 1300, Jacques de Moray, the last Grand Master,
made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Alexandria, and in 1303,
when he tried to found a settlement at Tortosa, not only the
power of the knights had gone but also their prestige. These
dates are necessary, because they show that as soon as the
Templars were proved incapable of doing the work for which
they existed, then the attack upon them commenced, and not
before.</p>

<p>The central house of the Templars in London was called
the Temple. At first it was built on the north-east corner of
Chancery Lane. Remains of this house were standing until
quite modern times. When the Order became richer, the members bought
a piece of ground stretching from Whitefriars to Essex House, and there
erected a splendid convent, of which the Chapel remains to this day. The
Master of the Temple was the Master of the English Templars. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
were, however, some fifty Preceptories scattered about the country, monastic
establishments, each ruled by a Prior, chiefly inhabited by sick or aged Templars.
The site of many of their Preceptories is still preserved by the name, as Temple
Combe in Somersetshire, Temple Rothley in Lincolnshire, and others. The
Priors of the Preceptories had in their hands the management of the estates and
the collection of the rents and dues.</p>

GEOFFREY DE MANDEVILLE</div>
</div>

<p>The Temple of London, in consequence of its garrison of knights, its monastic
character, and its privilege of sanctuary, became a place in
which great lords and even kings deposited their treasure.
Queen Berengaria’s dower was placed in the hands of the
Templars. Hubert de Burgh made the Temple his bank,
and the knights refused to let the King’s officers remove
the money and jewels he had given into their care. Kings
made the place their residence; King John was there
when his barons came to him demanding the “liberties
and laws of King Edward.” Henry the Third, after a
little quarrel with the Order, became reconciled to them,
and lived for a while in the Temple; he made them the
guardians of his treasure; he was present at the consecration
of the Chancel of their Church in 1240. And he
sent certain Castilian Ambassadors to the Temple as his
guests. But by the beginning of the fourteenth century
there is no doubt that the Templars had become unpopular.
The King could not be pleased to think of
manors and lordships which produced no revenues for the realm; the nobles
grudged the immunities of the Order, and remembered that the lands of
the Templars had once belonged to their ancestors before they were piously
alienated; merchants could not with patience behold the annual transmission
of vast sums of money out of the country; the Bishops lusted after the tithes,
and regarded the Templars with suspicion and dislike as a united body over whom
they had no authority. Finally, soldiers and military historians remembered
that in the last days in Palestine the Order would own no subordination to King,
Bishop, or Council; the knights stood apart, a compact body; so far, it was said,
from supporting the Cross in the Holy Land, they did their best by their stubborn
independence to pull it down. War has no rule more rigid and inflexible than
the rule of obedience to one general. This rule the Templars had broken. That
they fought with valour no one could deny, but they fought for themselves. Lastly,
since there was no more fighting in Palestine, and no hope of any, why go on
sending all their treasure out of the country? And what good were the Knights
Templars any longer? There had been signs of coming storm after the fall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Acre in 1291. Edward the First seized the money intended to be sent to Cyprus
on the ground that the purpose for which it had been sent in former years no
longer existed. He gave it up, it is true, at the request of the Pope. Before
this he had seized ten thousand pounds belonging to the Templars, and this
money he did not return. Edward the Second also took away from the Temple
fifty thousand pounds of silver, with a quantity of gold, jewels, and precious stones.
That these acts of violence were committed without remonstrance or redress
indicates that the power of the Templars had greatly diminished. These considerations—coupled
with the intolerable pride of the knights and their splendour,
which mocked the smaller gentry—were sufficient to account for the unpopularity
of the Order and for the general acquiescence in its suppression. And with
societies as well as with men when they become unpopular, sinister rumours began
to be whispered, crimes began to be alleged, words began to be reported.</p>

<p>On 6th June 1306 Clement the Fifth addressed an invitation to the Grand
Masters of the Templars and the Hospitallers inviting them both to a conference
as to the recovery of the Holy Land. It is thought that it was his intention to
overwhelm both Orders in one common destruction. Since, however, a great
part of the property of the Templars was afterwards given to the Hospitallers,
it is not probable that this was the Pope’s intention. Jacques de Moray, Grand
Master of the Templars, accepted: the Grand Master of the Hospitallers declined
to be present. De Moray arrived in France with sixty knights and a long train
of sumpter mules bearing his treasure, estimated at 150,000 golden florins, and
a vast quantity of silver. On September 14 the King, without waiting for the
Pope’s consent, issued secret orders to all his seneschals instructing them to summon
each a powerful force on the night of October 12; not to open the orders until that
night, and then to execute them. On that night every Templar in France was
arrested. The world heard with amazement that this great and valiant order
was guilty of the most frightful crimes. These were arranged under five heads:</p>

<p>(1) That at their initiation they denied Christ and spat upon the Cross.</p>

<p>(2) That they worshipped an idol of some monstrous form.</p>

<p>(3) That they gave and received disgusting kisses at these receptions.</p>

<p>(4) That they omitted the words of consecration in the mass.</p>

<p>(5) That they practised unnatural vices.</p>

<p>There were other and minor charges. Among them, for instance, that the
Grand Master claimed the power of granting absolution; that they wore a magical
cord; that they were in secret league with the Mohammedans. How these
charges arose it is impossible to prove; it was said that they came from one Squin
de Florian, a man who had been imprisoned on account of his corrupt life, and
according to others a certain Nosso, an apostate Templar, who between them
devised and invented the whole.</p>

</div>

<p>How those charges became an indictment of the Templars in Paris; how they
were tortured until they confessed, and slowly burned to death when they retracted,
belongs to the general history of the Order. Here we have only to do with the
Templars in London. The French King, Philippe, sent a messenger, one Bernard
Peletin, to Edward the Second, his son-in-law, informing him of the detestable
crimes of which the Templars were guilty, and urging him to follow his example.
Edward refused at first to believe the charges. But the Pope wrote to the same
effect; and, against his wishes, Edward had no choice but to arrest the Templars
in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The arrest was made on the 8th of January.
By this time, the news from Paris had spread over every Preceptory in the
country; many anticipated their arrest by flight; but the leaders, the Master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the Temple, the Priors, and the chief officers made no attempt to escape. The
knights, with the exception of the Master, who was liberated on bail, were kept
prisoners till September in the following year, when the two inquisitors appointed
by the Pope arrived. There were in all 229 knights. There is reported to have
been a general scramble for the goods and chattels of the knights—no doubt the
Temple and the Preceptories were full of silver plate and tapestry and armour.
The trial began in the hall of the Bishop of London’s Palace. The first examination
in London, Dublin, York, and Lincoln produced nothing. All, without exception,
steadfastly denied the charges brought against them. At the same time, as the
Pope had sent a bull in which he assumed as already proved the guilt of the
Order, and the crime of which the members stood accused, the Inquisition was
bound to find the knights guilty. One should observe here that although as
yet no torture had been applied, the knights could not be ignorant of what was
being done in France, where tortures too dreadful to be written down were
applied to the unhappy prisoners. Probably they expected what was to follow.
The infamy of the torture, however, belongs to the Pope, not to Edward. The
Pope it was who wrote to admonish his dearest son that the “question” should
be applied. Edward gave way: he ordered that the prisoners should be confined
in separate rooms, and that the inquisitors should visit them, and do with their
bodies “whatsoever they should think fit, according to ecclesiastical law.” For
three months, therefore, the knights were subjected to question under torture.
Not one confessed anything. The Inquisitors then examined witnesses for the
prosecution. The evidence was, from beginning to end, hearsay. It discloses
a great deal of hatred towards the Templars, since these things could be whispered
about them, but there is not the least direct evidence. Then the knights drew
up a declaration of faith, which they handed in. It is full and explicit, and asserts
their orthodoxy and their belief in the strongest terms. Once more the torture
was applied. By this time the prisoners filled the City prisons. Some were
in the Tower, some were in the prison of Aldgate, some in that of Cripplegate,
some in that of Bishopsgate, some in that of Ludgate, and some in that of Newgate.</p>

<p>They were loaded with fetters; they were placed in solitary confinement; they
were kept in dungeons; they were living on bread and water; and thus weakened,
they were tortured by the Inquisition and worried by learned doctors of theology,
who succeeded at last in getting a confession from two serving brethren and one
chaplain. There was nothing in the confessions except what the Inquisitors
wanted. However, armed with that, they were able to satisfy the Pope. The
process against the Templars was at least more humane in London than in Paris.
Torture there was, but at the express command of the Pope; there was no burning,
not even of the Master; nor was there any of the accursed slow roasting which
makes the French business so atrocious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>What happened in London to terminate the Inquisition was this. The
Bishops of London, Winchester, and Chichester had an interview with some of
the Templars, and told them that they were clearly guilty of heresy in supposing
that the Grand Master had power of absolution, and that it would be well for
them, generally, to clear themselves of that and any other heresy of which they
might be accused. The prisoners replied that they were anxious to clear
themselves of any heresy into which they might have fallen. Observe that there
was not one word said about any of the five charges brought by Philip; these
were quietly dropped. The Templars, therefore, were publicly reconciled to the
Church, and absolved by a form of words in which it was guardedly said that “they
could not entirely purge themselves of the heresies set forth in the apostolic bull.”
Surely a verdict of not guilty could not be more plainly returned. Then the rest
were reconciled. All but William de Moray the Master. He died in prison of
a broken heart. At the same time, in Aragon, Portugal, Tarragona, and
Germany, the Order, though examined under torture, was pronounced innocent
of the charges brought against it. It was said, long afterwards, that with his
dying breath Jacques de Moray summoned Pope and King to meet him before
the judgment seat of God. Both of them died the year after. Everybody, it is
reported, and it was believed, connected with the trials and the cruelties, came to
a miserable end. The wretched man who invented the charges, Squin de Florian,
was hanged for some new crime. And as for the agonising death of Edward
the Second, men whispered that thus and thus had it been done unto him in return
for his treatment of the Templars. The voice of the people is difficult to hear in
the first decade of the fourteenth century, otherwise one would like to know what
they thought of the introduction of torture as a judicial instrument. For until
these trials torture was unknown in England. To be tried, to be hanged, to
have the hand struck off, to be branded, these things the people understood, but
torture they did not understand. Nay, so ignorant were they of the art and
method of torture that two Frenchmen were sent for to instruct the executioners.
Torture was always regarded, not only by the English people generally, but by
the judges and lawyers, with a shrinking and horror which did not exist on the
Continent, where they continued to torture prisoners until well into the eighteenth
century. There can be no doubt that the later hatred of the Roman Catholic
Religion was fomented and kept alive by the reports which came from Spain and
Portugal of the tortures inflicted by the Inquisition in the name of that religion.
The Tudor sovereigns occasionally inflicted torture. But the judges in 1628
declared that the torture of Villiers, the murderer of Buckingham, was illegal.
Considering the wholesale nature of the torture of the Templars, and that the
thing was done in the City prisons, and that it was well known to the Mayor
and Sheriffs, and therefore, one supposes, to all the world, one would expect some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
kind of shuddering recollection of the event in the minds of the people, some
lingering horror. But there is none. The flames of Smithfield, all laid to the
charge of Mary, remain in men’s minds. But the cruel torture of these men, and
their unmerited sufferings, passed at once out of mind and were forgotten. For
three years and a half the English Templars were in prison. They were arrested
in January 1308 and released in 1311. In April 1312, at a Council held at
Vienna, the Order was finally suppressed.</p>

<p>The property of the Templars—by order of the Pope—was given to the
Knights Hospitallers. Their personal property, their vast heaps of gold and
silver plate, their furniture, tapestry, armour, precious stuffs, their sacks of money
were seized and scrambled for at the outset. When a rich Preceptory was
suddenly left empty and deserted save for a few outdoor servants, anybody, any
neighbouring Baron, could step in and clear out the contents. Their manors and
lordships, their churches, villages, tolls and rights were given away by King
Edward with a lavish hand. No king, as yet, since William the Conqueror, had
had so much to give as Edward; nor would any king again have so much till the
Dissolution of the Houses. The Pope expostulated. But it was difficult to make
the new owners give up their holdings: an Act of Parliament was passed; it
proved futile. Later on, in the reign of Edward the Third, another Act was
passed, and some of the property was given to the Hospitallers. In France,
Philip handed over the whole, but so charged and laden by his own demands that
the Hospitallers found themselves none the richer.</p>

<p>The evidence and the confessions suggest certain observations. For instance,
the knights wore a magical cord. That there was a cord is clear, and they all
wore it, but they were mostly in ignorance of its meaning. It was intended to
remind them of their vows of chastity; it was supposed to have been passed round
the waist of the Virgin. The cord remained, but its symbolical meaning was lost.
Then as to the denial of their religion, the kiss of brotherhood, and so forth.
There have been, and are still, many societies of men in which there is a secret
form of initiation, with ceremonies which are symbolical. I see no reason at all
to doubt that at the initiation of a Templar he was led into the Hall naked or
in a shirt only—he was to be penniless, naked, without arms, helpless—all
temporal gifts he was to receive from his brethren. Is it too much to suppose
that he went through the form of worshipping an idol indicated by a statue
or picture while in this naked, prehistoric condition, in order that he might
receive his religion also from the knights, and so owe everything in this
world and the next to the Brotherhood? Considering other initiations of which
one has learned something, I am quite prepared to admit the probability of such
a ceremony. As to the origin of the reports and rumours, it is quite enough to
live in an ignorant age, to be raised above the common herd by wealth, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
separated from the rest of the world, and to observe secrecy as regards certain
forms and ceremonies. Against such men reports and rumours will speedily
arise and spread abroad and fill the whole land. And these, it is very certain,
will not be reports of virtue or rumours of sanctity.</p>

<p>The transference of the property of the Templars to their rivals makes one
doubt that the object of the Pope was plunder. Since we cannot believe that
he had destroyed one Order, on account of its wealth and power, only to make
another Order richer and more powerful still, it seems certain that the jealousy
of the Templars’ wealth was not the cause of the Pontiff’s action. Was it,
then, really a belief in the charges brought against them? We have seen that
there was no evidence, so far as has been recorded, to support these charges: that
in Spain, Portugal, and Germany the Order was found “not guilty”: that a
verdict practically amounting to “not guilty” was found in London: and that
in Paris only were the knights sentenced to be punished as heretics and relapsed
heretics. If Clement the Fifth actually believed in the hearsay evidence of
improbabilities amounting to impossibilities, he must have possessed far less of
the judicial faculty than belongs even to the ecclesiastical mind. Had such a
man been a layman he would be set down as the most mischievous fool that ever
sat upon a bench of justice. We will suppose that Clement was not a fool, what
then? Why did he write those bulls? Was it in accordance with the sixth
condition agreed upon with Philip? Is Philip, and Philip alone, responsible
for this terrible crime, the greatest of all the Mediæval crimes? Did he destroy
the Order simply and solely for the sake of its wealth? And did he, in order
to get a handle, make use of the ignorant and idle gossip which was current as
to the morals and customs of the Secret House? And to all these questions it
is useless even to suggest an answer.</p>

<small>THE CLERKENWELL NUNNERY</small></h3>


<p>It has been generally believed that the founder of the Convent, dedicated to
the Honour of God and the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was one Jordan
Briset about the year 1100. Stow speaks as if there was no doubt of the matter
at all:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Beyond this house of St. John’s, was the Priory of Clerkenwell, so called of Clarks-Well adjoining;
which Priory was also founded, about the Year 1100, by Jorden Briset, Baron, the son of Ralph, the son
of Brian Briset: Who gave to Robert, a Priest, fourteen Acres of Land, lying in the Field next adjoining
the said Clarks-Well, thereupon to build an House for religious persons, which he built to the Honour of
God, and the Assumption of our Lady; and placed therein black Nuns. This Jorden Briset gave also
to that House one piece of Ground, thereby to build a Windmill upon, etc. Upon the Dissolution of this
Priory, it became a Parish Church, called St. James, Clerkenwell.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. J. H. Round, however, has discovered that the date of the Foundation
has been placed too early, and that the founder was not Jordan Briset at all, but a
certain person identified as the younger son of a Domesday under-tenant, who
had himself founded the Priories of Bricett for Austin Friars and of Stanegate for
Cluniac Monks. Both this House and the Priory of St. John adjacent were
founded, in Mr. Round’s view, about the year 1145.</p>

<p>The value of the House at the surrender was, according to Dugdale,
£262: 19: 0; according to Speed, £282: 16: 5. In the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> there is
not a single bequest to the nuns of this House.</p>

<p>Isabella, the last prioress, was a daughter of Sir Richard Sackville. She
furnishes another instance tending to prove that the monasteries and nunneries had
fallen into the hands of the noble and gentle families. She received a pension of
fifty pounds a year on the Dissolution; she died in 1569, and was buried in her own
church.</p>

<p>The site of the House was given to the Duke of Norfolk, who exchanged it
with the King for another place. Then Walter Henley and John Williams, knights,
got a grant of it. It passed through many hands during the next hundred years.
Among others, it was possessed by Sir Thomas Challoner, tutor to Prince Henry,
son of James the First. He built a spacious house within the Close of the Priory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
on the front of which he engraved the following lines, a rare tribute to the memory
of the departed Sisters:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Some remains of the cloisters were standing in 1785. They were figured in
the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for that year.</p>

<p>The Church of St. James was originally the choir of the nunnery, and was made
a Parish Church on the Dissolution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Strype, in his additions to Stow’s account of the church, says, ‘About the year 1623 the steeple
fell down, having stood time out of mind without any reparation; nor among the records of that church
could any mention be found of any such thing. This Steeple in the rebuilding thereof, and being near
finishing, fell again, upon the undertaker’s neglect in not looking into the strength of that upon which he
was to rear such a burthen. With the steeple fell the bells, their carriages and frames, beating a great
part of the roof down before them, the weight of all these together bearing to the ground two large pillars
of the south aisle, a fair gallery over against the pulpit, the pulpit, all the pews, and whatsoever was under
or near it.’ The church, however, was thoroughly repaired, and the steeple renewed, by 1627, at the
expense of £1400.</p>

<p>On August 25th, 1788, the ground was first prepared for the reception of a new church, which was
consecrated on July 10th, 1792, by Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London.” (<cite>London and Middlesex

<small>ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST, OR HOLIWELL NUNNERY</small></h3>


<p>The nunnery of Haliwell, or Holywell, was named after a holy spring or well on
the eastern extremity of Finsbury Fields, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.
There were many other holy wells around London, especially that in the Strand,
west of St. Clement Danes. How one spring came to be accounted holy above
other springs, one knows not. However, there can be no doubt that this spring in
Shoreditch was a place of considerable resort and great sanctity, which was reason
enough why its owner, Robert Fitz Gelran, Canon of St. Paul’s, should enclose it
with a wall, and to erect a nunnery over it. The House was built to the honour
of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and St. John Baptist for Benedictine nuns. This
was done about the year 1127. Robert, Earl of Gloucester, Richard the
First, Henry de Hallingbury, Simon, Bishop of Ely, John de Gatesbey,
Richard de Beaumes, Bishop of London, Stephen Gravesend, Bishop of London,
Sir Thomas Lovell, were the chief benefactors of this House. Richard the
First gave the nuns a part of the moor, on which their House was built; he
also gave them the church at Dunton, with land in Bedfordshire, at Camberwell, in
Surrey, and in the City of London. It is unnecessary to enumerate all the gifts.
Very shortly before the Dissolution, the House was rebuilt by Sir Thomas Lovell.
He endowed it with more land, and was buried in a chapel built by himself for his
sepulchre, little dreaming that in less than a generation the House and the Chapel
and all the rest would be destroyed. On the painted windows and on the walls
were inscribed the verses:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“All ye nuns of Haliwell</div>
   <div class="verse">Pray ye both day and night</div>
   <div class="verse">For the soul of Sir Thomas Lovell</div>
   <div class="verse">Whom Harry the Seventh made knight.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Holiwell Nunnery, on surrender, had a yearly revenue of £293 according to
Stow, of £347: 1: 3 according to Speed.</p>

<p>In 1553 the following sisters were still living, and in the receipt of pensions:—Sibilla
Nudigate, per annum, L <i>li.</i>; Elena Claver, per annum, liij <i>s.</i> iiij <i>d.</i>; Alicia
Marteine, per annum, iiij <i>li.</i>; Alicia Goldwell, per annum, iiij <i>li.</i> vj <i>s.</i> viij <i>d.</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Beatrica Fitzlewas, per annum, Lxvj <i>s.</i> viij <i>d.</i>; Agnes Bolney, per annum,
Liij <i>s.</i> iiij <i>d.</i></p>

<p>In 1544 Queen Catherine Parr asked for the site for Henry Webbe. His
daughter brought the place to her husband, Sir George Peckham. The Church and
House being pulled down, houses were built on the site “for the lodgings of
noblemen, of strangers born and other.”</p>

<p>In 1785 the last fragment of importance, a stone gateway, was pulled down:
there still continued to be shown some walls, a small arch, and part of a doorway in
a cellar of a tavern called “The Old King John.”</p>

<p>On the site of the ground belonging to the House were built two of the early
theatres—“The Curtain” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> “The Theatre.”</p>

<small>BERMONDSEY ABBEY</small></h3>


<p>The absolute oblivion into which this once noble House has fallen, so that there is
no longer, among the people living on its very site, any memory or tradition of its
existence, is not without a parallel in the case of other London Houses. Yet it is
remarkable for the reason that its site and its gardens remained open and unbuilt
over until a hundred years ago, while, almost within the memory of man, many
ruins and portions of the former buildings still remained.</p>

<p>The internal history of the Abbey is naturally without interest. The list of
Priors and Abbots has been preserved: there were sixty-nine from the Foundation
of the House in 1082 until the Dissolution in 1538. The duration of each Prior’s
rule was therefore an average of six years and a half; but many of them died very
shortly after their election, a proof that the election went, as a rule, by seniority;
or, at least, that the brethren chose for their chief one who was well stricken in
years and of long experience.</p>

<p>The House was at first, and for three hundred years, an alien Priory
dependent on that of Cluny. It was founded by a citizen of London named Aylwin
or Æthelwine Child, in the year 1082. The Cluniacs were brought into this
country by William, Earl of Warren, who, with Gunhilda his wife, stayed at Cluny,
and was greatly impressed with the sanctity and the devotion of the brethren.
He persuaded the Abbot to allow some of the monks to come to England, and in
1077 established a Cluniac House at Lewes. Another followed at Wenlock, and,
in 1082, this House of Bermondsey.</p>

<p>Among the benefactors of the House were William Rufus; Mary, sister to the
Queen of Henry the First; that King himself; King Stephen; the Earls of
Gloucester and Stafford; and many others. In 1390, under Richard the Second,
Bermondsey ceased to be an alien Priory, and was made denizen. This was not
without a remonstrance from Cluny. Fifty years later three Cluniac monks were
sent over to set forth the claims of the Mother House. The brethren stated their
case, but could not get any attention paid to their arguments. One of them died in
this country, the other two went home having accomplished nothing. A piteous
letter to the Abbot of St. Albans explains their position:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>“For the rest, be it known to you, my Lord, that after having spent four
months and a half on our journey, and following our Right with the most serene
Lord the King and his Privy Council, we have obtained nothing: nay, we are
sent back very disconsolate, deprived of our Manors, our Pensions alienated, and
what is still worse, we are denied the obedience of all our Monasteries which are
38 in number: nor did our Legal Deeds, nor the Testimonies of your Chronicles
avail us anything, and at length, after all our pleading and expenses, we return home
moneyless, for in truth, after paying for what we have eaten and drunk, we have but
five crowns left, to go back about 260 leagues. But what then? We will sell what
we have; we will go on; and God will provide. Nothing else occurs to write to
your Paternity: but that as we entered England with joy, so we depart thence with
sorrow; having buried one of our Companions—viz. the Archdeacon, the youngest
of our company. May he rest in Peace! Amen.”</p>

<p>In 1309, by a breach in the River Wall, the lands of the House were so much
damaged that the brethren were exempted from the purveyance of hay and corn.</p>

<p>In 1324 Edward the Second issued letters patent for the arrest of the prior,
John de Causancia, and certain monks for harbouring rebels. These were probably
the adherents of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who, after his defeat at Boroughbridge,
took sanctuary in the Abbey. In 1337 the Bishop of Ely excommunicated
certain persons for stealing a hawk belonging to him from the cloisters of the
Abbey. Many other associations gather round this House. Marmion, Lord
of Fontenay, was a benefactor to Bermondsey; the monks sold their lands in
Southwark in the reign of Richard the Second to Robert of Paris, from whom the
place was called Paris Gardens; Cardinal Beaufort visited the Abbey, and was
received in procession by the monks. The Prior Henry, afterwards Abbot of
Glastonbury, took an active part in the release of King Richard.</p>

<p>In 1323 the greater church of St. Saviour of Bermondsey and the great altar
were dedicated in honour of St. Saviour and the Blessed Virgin and All Saints.
On the same day were dedicated three other altars in the church—one of the
Cross, one in honour of the Virgin and St. Thomas the Martyr, and one in honour
of St. Andrew and St. James and all the Apostles.</p>

<p>Among those buried here were Leofstan, Portreeve of London in 1115;
William of Mortain, or Mortaigne, Earl of Cornwall; Mary, daughter of Malcolm
the Third of Scotland, and sister to Queen Maud, who died April 18, 1115. The
following is the inscription on her tomb:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Nobilis hic tumulata jacet Comitissa Maria:</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Actebus hæc nituit: larga benigna fuit.</div>

   <div class="verse indent2">Compatiens in opi: vivit in arce Poli.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Also Matilda, daughter of Guy, Earl of Warwick, who died in 1368; Margaret de
la Pole; Anne, widow of Lord Audley, and the murdered Duke of Gloucester,
before the removal of his body to Westminster.</p>

<p>But the most illustrious residents of the House were the two Queens who died
within its walls.</p>

<p>The first of them was Katherine of Valois, widow of Henry the Fifth, who
married secretly Owen Tudor, and was the grandmother of Henry the Seventh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
The marriage was not found out for some years. The Queen must have been most
faithfully and loyally served, because children cannot be born without observation.
Owen Tudor must have conducted matters with a discretion beyond all praise. No
doubt the ordinary members of the household knew nothing, and suspected nothing,
because several years passed before any suspicion was awakened. Three sons and
one daughter, in all, were born. The eldest, Edmund of Hadham, was so called
because he was born there; the second, Jasper, was of Hatfield; the third, Owen,
of Westminster; the youngest, Margaret, died in infancy.</p>

<p>Suspicions were aroused about the time of the birth of Owen, which took place
apparently before it was expected, and without all the precautions necessary, in the
King’s House at Westminster. The infant was taken as soon as born to the
monastery of St. Peter’s secretly. It is not likely that the Abbot received the
child without full knowledge of his parents. He did take the child, however; and
here little Owen remained, growing up in a monastery, and taking vows in due time.
Here he lived and here he died, a Benedictine of Westminster.</p>

<p>It would seem as if Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, heard some whisper or
rumour concerning this birth, or was told something about the true nature of the
Queen’s illness, for he issued a very singular proclamation, warning the world,
generally, against marrying Queen-dowagers, as if these ladies grew on every hedge.
When, however, a year or so afterwards, the fourth child, Margaret, was born,
Humphrey learned the whole truth: the degradation, as he thought it, of the Queen,
who had stooped to such an alliance with a man of humble rank, and the audacity of
the Welshman. He took steps promptly. He sent Katherine with some of her
ladies to Bermondsey Abbey, there to remain in honourable confinement: he
arrested Owen Tudor, also a priest—probably the priest who had performed the
marriage—and his servant, and sent all three to Newgate.</p>

<p>All three succeeded in breaking prison and escaping. At this point the story
gets mixed. The King himself, we are told, then a lad of fifteen, sent to Owen
commanding his attendance before the Council. Why did they not arrest him
again? Owen, however, refused to trust himself to the Council—was not
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, one of them? He asked for a safe-conduct.
They promised him one by a verbal message. Where was he, then, that all these
messages should be sent backwards and forwards? I think he must have been in
Sanctuary. He refused a verbal message, and demanded a written safe-conduct.
This was granted him, and he returned to London. But he mistrusted even the
written promise; he would not face the Council; he took refuge in the Sanctuary
of Westminster, where they were afraid to seize him. And here for a while he
remained. It is said that they tried to draw him out by sending old friends, who
invited him to the taverns outside the Abbey Precinct. But Owen would not be so
drawn. He knew that Duke Humphrey would make an end of him if he could.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
He therefore remained where he was. I think that he must have had some secret
understanding with the King; for one day, learning that Henry himself was with
the Council, he suddenly presented himself and pleaded his own cause. The mild
young King, tender on account of his mother, would not allow the case to be
pursued, but bade him go free.</p>

<p>He departed, and made all haste to get out of such unwholesome air; he made
for Wales. Here the hostility of Duke Humphrey pursued him still; he was once
more arrested, taken to Wallingford, and placed in the Castle there a prisoner.
From Wallingford he was transferred again to Newgate, he and his priest and his
servant. Once more they all three broke prison, “foully” wounding a warder in the
achievement of liberty, and got back to Wales, choosing for their residence the
mountainous parts, into which the English garrisons never penetrated.</p>

<p>When the King came of age, Owen Tudor was allowed to return, and was
presented with a pension of £40 a year. It is remarkable, however, that he
received no promotion or rank; that he was never knighted; and that the title of
Esquire was the only one by which he was known. It certainly seems as if the
claim of Owen Tudor to be called a gentleman was not recognised by the King or
the heralds. Perhaps Welsh gentility was as little understood by these Normans
as Irish royalty—yet, so far as length of pedigree goes, both Welsh and Irish were
very superior to Normans.</p>

<p>The two sons, Edmund and Jasper, were placed under the charge of Katherine
de la Pole, Abbess of Barking, and sister of the Earl of Suffolk. When the King
came of age, he remembered his half-brothers; Edmund was made Earl of
Richmond, Jasper, Earl of Pembroke; both ranked before all other English Earls.
Edmund was afterwards married to Margaret Beaufort, who, as Countess of
Richmond, was the foundress of Christ’s and St. John’s Colleges, Cambridge. Her
son, as everybody knows, was Henry the Seventh.</p>

<p>As for Owen Tudor, that gallant adventurer, who began so well on the field of
battle, ended as well, fighting, as he should, for his stepson and King, under the
badge of the Red Rose. When the Civil Wars began, he joined the King’s forces,
though he was then nearer seventy than sixty. He fought at Wakefield; he
pursued the Yorkists to Mortimer’s Cross, where another fight took place. The
Lancastrians were defeated. Owen was taken prisoner, and was cruelly beheaded
on the field. It was right and just that he should so fight and should so die. He
survived his Queen twenty-four years.</p>

<p>Katherine lived no more than a year after her imprisonment. She made a
will shortly before her death, in which there is not one word about her second
husband or her children by Owen Tudor. She says in the preamble: “I trustfully,”
addressing her son the King,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> “and am quite sure, that among all creatures earthly
ye best may and will best tender and favour my will, in ordaining for my soul and
body, in seeing that my debts be paid and my servants guerdoned, and in tender
and favourable fulfilment of mine intent.”</p>

<p>The second Queen, who died at Bermondsey Abbey, was Elizabeth Woodville.
Her imprisonment in the Abbey was regarded with great surprise. It was in the
year 1486, when the insurrection broke out in Ireland in favour of the pretended
Earl of Warwick, son of the Duke of Clarence: a council was held, after which,
without any cause assigned, or the bringing of any charge, the widowed Queen
was carried to Bermondsey, where she remained for the rest of her life. The reason
commonly accepted was that she knew Edward Plantagenet, and so could prompt
and instruct the Pretender in his personation of the prince. Bacon says, “That
which is most probable out of the precedent and subsequent acts is that it was the
Queen Dowager from whom this action had had the principal source and motive;
certain it is she was a busy, negotiating woman, and in her withdrawing chamber
had the fortunate conspiracy of the King against Richard the Third been hatched,
which the King knew and remembered but too well; and she was at the time
extremely discontent with the King, thinking her daughter, as the King handled
the matter, not advanced but depressed.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to find much sympathy with this unfortunate woman, yet there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
are few scenes in history more full of pathos and mournfulness than that in which
her boy Richard was torn from her arms; and she knew—all knew—even the
Archbishops, when they gave their consent, knew—that the boy was to be done to
death. When one talks of Queens and their misfortunes, it may be remembered
that few Queens have suffered more than Elizabeth Woodville. In misfortune she
sits apart from other Queens, her only companions being Mary Queen of Scots and
Marie Antoinette. Her record is full of woe. But in that long war it seems
impossible to find one single character, man or woman—unless it is King Henry—who
is true and loyal. All—all are perjured, treacherous, cruel, self-seeking. All
are as proud as Lucifer. Murder is the friend and companion of the noblest lord,
perjury walks on the other side of him, treachery stalks behind him, all are his
henchmen. Elizabeth met perjury and treachery with intrigue and plot and
counter-plot; she was the daughter of her time. She was accused of being privy
to the plots of Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck; she was more Yorkist than
her husband; she hated the Red Rose long after the Red and the White were
united in her daughter and Henry the Seventh. That she was suspected of these
intrigues shows the character she bore. We must make allowance; she was always
in a false position; Edward ought not to have married her; she was hated by her
own party; she was compelled, in the interests of her children, to be always on the
defensive; and in her conduct of defence she was the daughter of her age. These
things, however, deprive her, somewhat, of the pity which we ought to feel for so
many misfortunes.</p>

<p>She, too, had to retire to the seclusion of Bermondsey, where she could sit
and watch the ships go up and down, and so feel that the world, with which she
had no more concern, still continued. It has been suggested that she retired
voluntarily to the Abbey. Such a retreat was not in the character of Elizabeth
Woodville, so long as there was a daughter or a kinsman left to fight for. Like
Katherine of Valois, she made an end not without dignity. Witness the following
clauses in her will:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Item, I bequeath my body to be buried with the body of my lord at Windsor, according to the
will of my said lord and mine, without pomps entering or costly expenses done thereabout. Item,
whereas I have no worldly goods to do the Queen’s Grace, my dearest daughter a pleasure with, neither
to reward any of my children, according to my heart and mind, I beseech Almighty God to bless her
Grace, with all her noble issue: and with as good a heart and mind as is to me possible, I give her Grace
my blessing, and all aforesaid, my children. Item, I will that such small stuff and goods that I have be
disposed truly in the contentation of my debts and for the health of my soul as far as they will extend.
Item, if any of my blood will any of the said stuff or goods to me pertaining, I will that they have the
preferment before any other.”</p></blockquote>

A GENERAL VIEW OF THE REMAINS OF BERMONDSEY ABBEY, SURREY<br />
As it appeared in the year 1805, with the adjacent country. Taken from the steeple of the Church of St. Mary Magdalen.
</div>
</div>

<p>The position of Bermondsey Abbey would at first appear to have been exactly
similar to that of Westminster: both Abbeys stood upon islets slightly raised above
high-water mark; all round the islet of each stretched marshes, with other tiny islets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
here and there, as at Chelsea and Battersea. But there was this difference. In
front of Thorney was a ford; at the back of Thorney was a ford; beyond the ford
on the south was the high road to Dover; beyond the ford on the north was the
high road to the heart of the country. Bermondsey was near the river, but the
river here was broad and deep even at low tide; Bermondsey was not situated on
the high road of commerce; the high road to Dover was near the Abbey, certainly,
but not running right through it, so to speak, as the road ran at Westminster.
The Abbey lay quiet and remote, even from Southwark; and after the building of
the river wall on the south, whenever that was done, the marshes became low-lying
meadows, dotted with ponds and with trees, where cows lay asleep in the sun.
The Abbey stood alone, removed from houses, among gardens and orchards; it
might almost have been in the country, so quiet and peaceful were the surroundings.
But from the river there was heard the yeo-heave-ho of the sailors; the masts and
sails could be seen above the river wall; there was heard every day the hymn of
praise with which the sailors celebrated their safe arrival in port; and the
sound of the multitudinous bells of London was wafted across the river to this
peaceful spot.</p>

<p>The Abbey possessed a miraculous Rood, to which people paid pilgrimage.
It was one of the many shrines round London which were convenient for a day’s
pleasant journey into the country. In the Paston Letters, John Paston writes, “I
pray you visit the Rood of Saint Saviour in Bermondsey while ye abide in London,
and let my sister Margery go with you to pray to them that she shall have a good
husband or she come home again.”</p>

<p>This holy Rood was found in the Thames in 1117, and began almost immediately
to work miracles. In 1118 William, Earl of Morton, was “miraculously
liberated from the Tower of London through the power of this holy Cross.”</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later, the same William, Earl of Morton, entered the Abbey
and took the vows. The Rood was taken down on the same day that the Rood
of Grace of Kent was destroyed by the Bishop of Rochester at Paul’s Cross.</p>

<p>One of the last acts of Henry the Seventh was to found an “anniversary” in
this House to pray for the good and prosperous estate of the King during his life,
for the prosperity of the realm, for the soul of his late Queen Elizabeth—not
Elizabeth Woodville, of whom no mention is made, for the soul of Edmund, Earl
of Richmond, the King’s father, and of Margaret, Countess of Richmond, his
mother; and for the souls of his children.</p>

<p>At the Dissolution, the revenues of the House were valued at £548: 2: 5-1/2.
The Abbot, who was made Bishop of St. Asaph, received a pension of 500 marks,
or £333: 6: 8 a year. Fifteen years later, in 1553, there were still seven or eight
annuitants surviving, viz. one at 15 marks a year; three at 9; two at 8; and
smaller annuities amounting to 11 marks a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>The House and Manor were granted to Sir Robert Southwell, Master of the
Rolls. He sold it to Sir Thomas Pope, founder of Trinity College, Oxford.
Sir Thomas pulled down many of the monastic buildings, and erected a stately
house with the materials. The house with the gardens he sold to Sir Robert
Southwell, from whom he had bought it; the Manor he sold to Robert Trapps,
citizen and goldsmith.</p>

<p>In 1583 the Earl of Sussex, Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth, died in
the House.</p>

<p>The parish church of St. Mary Magdalen was built by the monks for their
tenants. The Earl of Sussex had to rebuild it when it was reported to be falling
into a ruinous condition.</p>

<p>Among the various benefits conferred upon the country by the monastic
houses, that of hospitality was by no means the least. But it is evident that
hospitality could only be practised when the House stood near to a highway. As
Bermondsey Abbey was removed from any roads or highways, the monks could
only carry out their duties towards the poor by placing their almonry on the High
Street of Southwark. But the Abbey possessed a school of great repute. Leland,
in his <cite>Cantu Cygni</cite>, written a few years before the Dissolution, says:</p>

<small>ST. MARY OVERIES</small></h3>


<p>The Priory of St. Mary Overies, or Overy, was one of the most ancient Houses in
London. It stood beside the ferry, the south end of which was the long and
narrow dock still to be seen, close to the present church. The other end of the
ferry may be also still existing in what is now called Dowgate Dock; it is true
that this is not opposite, but it may be surmised that Allhallows Lane led to
the north end of the ferry. This ferry existed long before London Bridge was
built, and continued long after. Indeed, if we consider the narrowness of the old
bridge, the tolls, crowded vehicles blocking the way, and the long delays that
must have occurred in getting across the bridge, we may very well understand
that it might be more expeditious and cheaper to cross by the ferry than the
bridge. Here, at all events, was the ferry, and at the south end was a small convent
of nuns engaged in praying for the safety of the travellers. At every starting-point
or returning-point for the mediæval traveller, there was some religious foundation to
pray for his safety or to offer praises for his return; at four of the London gates,
there were churches dedicated to St. Botolph, the chosen saint of travellers. Outside
Cripplegate was the Church of St. Giles. Outside Newgate was the Church of
St. Sepulchre. Within Ludgate was the Church of St. Martin. Over Fleet Bridge
was the Church of St. Bride. When the first stone bridge was erected over the
Thames, a double chapel was built in the midst of it; while it was only a wooden
bridge, there was a chapel at either end—the south chapel, singularly, dedicated to a
Danish saint. So that I am inclined to believe that the small nunnery on the south
of the ferry may possibly have had its sister nunnery or church on the north; if a
nunnery, its existence has been clean forgotten; if a church, then All Hallows the
Great may have been that church.</p>

</div>

<p>The story of the first foundation is entirely legendary; one Mary, daughter of
Awdry, ferryman, is said to have founded on the site a small House for nuns before
the Conquest. It was converted, according to tradition, by one Swithina into a
College of Priests. It was, however, refounded in 1106 by two Norman knights,
William Pont de l’Arche, who had a mansion in Dowgate, and William Dauncey, as
a House for Canons Regular. William Gifford, Bishop of Winchester, joined in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
foundation, and built the nave of the church. Henry the First, another benefactor,
gave to the House the Church of St. Margaret in Southwark; King Stephen gave
the Canons the House of their founder, Pont de l’Arche. In 1212 the Priory was
destroyed by fire. Then Peter de Rupibus took the foundation, still very poor, in
hand, and rebuilt the church; he also founded the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen,
afterwards made into a Parish Church. A hundred years later the unhappy monks
sent a petition to Edward the First, stating that the House had fallen into the
deepest poverty; that they had not enough to provide the barest necessaries, but
were dependent on charity; that their church was ruinous, but that they could not
rebuild it; and that they had even suffered the embankment to be carried away,
and were in daily terror of an inundation. They managed, however, to get along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
somehow during the fourteenth century. Early in the fifteenth the House found
two more benefactors—Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and Gower the poet.
The latter was buried in the church after residing for some years in the House.
His monument may still be seen. A list of the Priors from 1130 to 1540 has been
preserved. The House, on the Dissolution, was valued at £624: 6: 8. The
Prior received, on the surrender, a pension of £100 a year.</p>

<p>The position of the Priory, close to the Palace of the Bishop of Winchester,
made it convenient for many functions. In this church were married, in 1406, Edward
Holland, Earl of Kent, and Lucia, daughter of the Lord of Milan. Here also, in
1424, was married James the First, King of Scotland, a poet and scholar, of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Drummond of Hawthornden wrote that “of former kings it might be said that the
nation made the kings, but of this king, that he made the people a nation.” His
bride was Joan, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, and niece to Cardinal Beaufort.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In 1539 the House was suppressed and given to Sir Anthony Brown, whose
son became Lord Montague, giving his name to the ancient cloister of the
Monastery. In the following year the church was made parochial, including the
Church of St. Mary Magdalen, which stood beside it, as St. Gregory stood beside
St. Paul’s, or St. Margaret by Westminster Abbey, or St. Peter-le-Poor beside the
Church of the Austin Friars.</p>

<p>A great many monuments are in the church: the chancel, transepts, and tower,
with the Lady Chapel, still remain, forming the finest of the old churches in the
whole of London.</p>

<p>Here lie buried, according to tradition, Mary, the foundress; the two benefactors,
Pont de l’Arche and Dauncey—a wooden figure may represent one of
them; John Gower, on whose monument may still be read the words which he
wrote for it:—</p>

in the church; Laurence Fletcher, one of the shareholders in the Globe, who
died 1608; Philip Henslow, who died 1616; John Fletcher, who died 1625; Philip
Massinger, who died 1639. On the tomb of Richard Humble, who lies with his
two wives and his children, are the lines:—</p>

<p>In the Lady Chapel of this church were held many of the trials of the martyrs
under the Marian persecution: those, for instance, of Bishop Hooper, John Rogers,
Bradford, Crome, Saunders, Ferrar, and Taylor. The death of Gardiner, the
persecutor, seemed, to the common people, by the hand of God, in punishment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
his cruelties. He was given, however, a magnificent funeral, beginning at this
church. Machyn describes it:—</p>

Wilkinson, who gives several views of the church and the buildings around it,
has preserved one taken from the north-east, which shows the whole north side of
the church, with the Little Chapel, the Lady Chapel, and the church itself, in the
year 1813 (see <a href="#Page_307">p. 307</a>). Montague Close, where the view was taken, was very
shortly after covered with buildings, which prevented a repetition of a drawing from
this point; but in 1825 he procured a sketch of the Little Chapel and part of the
Lady Chapel.</p>

<p>The existence of the Little Chapel is nearly forgotten; yet it will be seen, in
considering the church as a whole, that it forms a natural part. In the year 1626
this chapel was selected as a fitting place for the tomb and monument of Lancelot
Andrewes, now in the Lady Chapel. From this monument the place was generally
called the Bishop’s Chapel.</p>

<p>It is by the greatest good fortune this beautiful church has been preserved.
It would most certainly have been taken down, like the exquisite church of the Holy
Trinity Priory, like those of Eastminster, Whitefriars, and Blackfriars, but for the
interference of Stephen Gardiner, who supported—and doubtless instigated—the
parishioners of St. Margaret’s and St. Mary Magdalene, in a petition to the King
praying for the church of the Priory as their parish church. The petition was
granted, and the church was saved.</p>

<p>Not, certainly, in the life of Stephen Gardiner, but after his death, in the time
of Queen Elizabeth, though the church was safe, the Lady Chapel, and, of course,
the Little Chapel with it, was desecrated. In Anthony Munday’s edition of Stow,
1633, he tells us to what base uses this noble chapel was put:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“It is now called, <em>The new Chappell</em>; and indeed, though very old, it now may be cal’d a new one,
because newly redeemed from such use and imployment, as in respect of that it was built to, Divine and
Religious duties, may very well be branded, with the stile of wretched, base, and unworthy, for that
before this abuse, was (and is now) a faire &amp; beautifull Chappell, by those that were then the Corporation
(which is a body consisting of 30. Vestry men, sixe of those thirty, Churchwardens) was leased and let out,
and this House of God made a Bake-house.</p>

<p>Two very faire doores, that from the two side Iles of the Chancell of this Church, and two that
throw the head of the Chancell (as at this day they doe againe) went into it, were lath’t, daub’d, and
dam’d up: the faire Pillars were ordinary posts, against which they piled Billets and Bavens; in this
place they had their Ovens, in that a Bolting-place, in that their Kneading-trough, in another (I have
heard) a Hogs-trough; for the words that were given mee were these, This place have I knowne a Hog-stie,
in another a Store-house, to store up their hoorded Meale: and in all of it, something of this sordid
kind &amp; condition.</p>

<p>It was first let by the Corporation afore named, to one Wyat, after him to one Peacocke, after
him to one Cleybrooke, and last to one Wilson, all Bakers, and this Chappell still imployed in the way
of their Trade, a Bake-house, though some part of this Bake-house was sometime turned into a
Starch-house.</p>

<p>The time of the continuance of it in this kind, from the first letting of it to Wyat, to the restoring of
it againe to the Church; was threescore and some odde yeeres, in the yeere of our Lord God 1624, for in
this yeere the ruines and blasted estate that the old Corporation sold it to, were by the Corporation of this
time repaired, renewed, well, and very worthily beautified; the charge of it for that yeere, with many
things done to it since, arising to two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>This, as all the former Repaires, being the sole cost and charge of the Parishioners.</p>

<p>One Ile in this Chappel, was paved at the onely cost of one Master <i>John Hayman</i>, Taylor, and
Merchantaylor, in the yeere 1625.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was, therefore, immediately after this restoration that the remains of Bishop
Andrewes were deposited in the Little Chapel. May there not have been some
thought of preventing further desecration by the monument of this learned Divine?</p>

<p>The Chapel was taken down in 1830. The monument of the Bishop took
up nearly the whole of the east end; a marble canopy originally stood over it,
but this was broken in 1676 when the roof of the Chapel fell in; there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
altar and there were no services held in the Chapel; there was one other
monument of a citizen named Hayman, buried here in the same year as the Bishop.
Another monument, erected in 1807, was that of Abraham Newland, chief cashier
of the Bank of England. Two stone coffins were preserved in this Chapel; and
here were stone steps leading down into the vaults; the Chapel is said to have
been quite plain, “with a groined roof, strong ribs, and a stone seat on both sides
and at the east end.”</p>

<p>The removal of the Chapel formed part of the restoration work of 1830. At
this time the church was in a most dangerous condition, the roof of the nave being
so dilapidated that it was impossible to hold service there. Consequently the
pews, organ, and monuments were removed to the chancel and transepts; the
roof was taken down and the materials sold; and the walls and aisles were simply
left exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>Wilkinson thus describes what followed:—</p>

<p>“The roof thus destroyed was a fine specimen of the architecture of the
thirteenth century, and possessed the striking peculiarity of having the corbels,
whence the ribs of the arches sprang, placed perpendicularly over the columns.
Those columns had been already banded with iron, and the walls were green and
dark with apparent decay, though it is said that some of the ancient timbers were
still in a fine state of preservation; but in pursuance of the above order, the organ
was removed to form a temporary termination to the choir, and the nave was
uncovered and exposed; in which lamentable state it still continues, August 1834,
not unlike the half-ruined edifice of the Cathedral of Llandaff.</p>

<p>The very laudable, zealous, and preserving efforts made for the preservation
of the Lady Chapel at the eastern end of the Church, were, however, completely
successful; though it was for some time earnestly debated whether it should be
destroyed or restored. But even in the vestry the design of demolition was
opposed, and on January 28th, 1832, a numerous general meeting for the preservation
of the structure took place at the Freemasons’ Tavern, at which a series of
Resolutions was passed to that effect. The principal of them were, That the
few remaining reliques of Gothic, or Early English Pointed style of architecture
in this kingdom, are replete with interest: That the Chapel of Our Lady in St.
Saviour’s Church is a splendid specimen of that style of architecture: That as
the Parish of St. Saviour has expended £30,000 in the repair of this Church,
of which a debt of £8000 is unpaid, it is expedient that a public subscription
be commenced to enable the Parish to restore the Lady Chapel; and that a
Committee be appointed to promote the restoration by soliciting public subscriptions.
Notwithstanding the very great expense, which the rebuilding of St.
Saviour’s Church had already proved to the Parish, it was evident, by some of
the speeches at this meeting, that the design of demolishing the Lady Chapel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
was not by any means even partially sanctioned in Southwark, but only that the
assistance of the public was required for so costly an undertaking; but it was
perhaps almost entirely owing to the unwearied and meritorious exertions of Mr.
Thomas Saunders, that so general and lively an interest was excited on the subject.
The estimated amount of the restoration was £2500, and by February nearly
£1400 had been raised; but the sentiments of the parishioners were most
equivocally displayed at the general poll which had been demanded by Mr.
Saunders of all the parochial rate-payers, and which took place on February 9th
and 10th; the conclusion being a majority of 240 for the restoration of the building.
The subscriptions were subsequently continued with great zeal, and were also
extended to the restoration of the ancient altar-screen in the choir; for the effecting
of all which they were aided by a performance of Sacred Music in the Church,
on Thursday, June 21st, 1832, and the delivery of some scientific lectures. The
superintendence of the Restoration was gratuitously undertaken by Mr. Gwilt,
Mr. Hartley was the contractor for the building, and the first stone of the new
works was laid July 28th, 1832. The two annexed modern Exterior Views of this
Church will convey an accurate notion of the appearance of the outside of the
Lady Chapel before this restoration; excepting that it then showed four dilapidated
and tiled gables, and that the part from which the Bishop’s Chapel had been
removed was white, whilst the remainder was defaced and discoloured stone,
coarsely repaired with brick. In taking down the arch which led into the Bishop’s
Chapel was discovered part of the fabric of the lancet-window originally in that
place; which became a most valuable model for the restoration of the others. In
the present perfected state of this edifice, the eastern end of it exhibits the four
original gables, each surmounted by a rich cross, and containing in the point a
small triple lancet window, with carved corbelheads and columnated-mullions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
with a large window of the same description below. The form of the glazing in
the latter consists of large intersected circles and lozenges; with some armorial
ensigns, etc., in stained glass. The roofs of the Chapel are covered with lead, and
the walls are of flints like those of the other restored parts of the Church, with
stone mouldings and quoins; the four buttresses, and the north-east turret containing
the staircase are also restored in a similar manner; the latter having
loopholes and a low cap of stone. On each side of the building also the peculiar
windows have been likewise carefully copied. Within, the Lady Chapel is 42
feet in length, and has the roof divided into nine groined arches, supported by
six octangular columns, with circular shafts at their angles. When this place was
formerly used for the Consistorial Court of the Bishop of Winchester, and the
Visitations of the Deanery of Southwark, the north-east corner was parted off
in the manner of a pew, and contained a desk, table, and elevated seat; but the
remainder of the space was abandoned to the reception of lumber.</p>

<p>Whilst the restoration of the Chapel was in agitation, a further difficulty
appeared in the very narrow frontage to be allowed for it on the south approach
forming to the New London Bridge. So early as November 1830, the Wardens
of St. Saviour’s addressed a memorial to the Bridge-Committee, soliciting a
sufficient space for the exhibition of the structure, and suggesting an opening
of 130 feet. On April 19th, 1831, it was resolved by the vestry that the width
of 60 feet, offered by the Committee, was altogether inadequate, added to which
it was made a condition of that grant that the Lady Chapel should be taken down;
and, therefore, in the following October the Wardens memorialised the Lords of
the Treasury. In an interview between them, the latter appeared to be in favour
of a greater opening, but on January 24th, 1832, the Wardens were informed that
not more than 70 feet would be allowed, and that space only on condition of
removing the Chapel, if the consent of the Bishop of Winchester could be procured.
In a letter on the subject, however, the Bishop declined giving his consent to the
London Bridge Company; stating that it could not be alleged that the removal
of the Consistorial Court was required for public accommodation, which he viewed
as the only justifiable reason for the demolition of a Church, or any part of one.
It was then resolved to petition the Committee of the House of Commons
appointed on the Bill for Improving the Approaches to the New London
Bridge; by which it was decided, on February 29th, 1832, after four days’
deliberation, and by a majority of 17 to 3, that the opening to St. Saviour’s
Church should be 130 feet instead of 70, as proposed by the original framers
of the Bill. The houses on the west side of Wellington Street opposite the
Lady Chapel, are therefore terminated so as to form the sides of a handsome
approach to it. From hence at a future time a flight of steps may be formed
to the building beneath, and an appropriate rail also erected round the church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
but at present the structure is defended on the east only by a high circular
enclosure of boards.</p>

<p>The last meritorious work of restoration in St. Saviour’s Church was that
of the ancient Altar Screen given in the commencement of the sixteenth century
by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester; a subscription for which was ultimately
united with that commenced for the Lady Chapel. To the latter of these funds
the present Bishop of Winchester gave £300, and £100 to the Screen; and other
large sums were speedily and liberally contributed. Previously to Mr. Gwilt’s
restoration of the choir, the eastern wall of the Church was covered with a
composition of wood and plaster, ascribed by tradition to Sir Christopher Wren,
though apparently without any authority. Above this Screen appeared the
mutilated and inelegant broad window of the sixteenth century, the arch of which
was sculptured in relievo, in panels; that in the centre having an angel holding
a shield, and those at the side, a pelican feeding her young, the emblem of Christ,
and the device of Bishop Fox. There was also a carved facia, on which the
pelican was repeated, with the holy lamb and oak leaves, the style of all which
entirely disagreed with that of the altar-piece below. On the removal of the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
screen, a series of small tabernacle-niches was discovered on the partition behind, the
canopies of which had been cut down to almost a level surface; though they still
possessed so much beauty as to cause the restoration of the whole to become a
circumstance of the greatest interest. This was completed in the commencement
of 1834, by Mr. Robert Wallace, the Architect of the Church, Mr. Firth, the
Contractor, and Mr. Purdy, the principal Carver; the contract amounting to only
the sum of £700. The ancient material of this Screen was Firestone and the stone
of Caen; and the restoration has been executed in stone from Painswick, in
Gloucestershire, which agrees well with the former. Wherever it was practicable
the original work has been retained, but nearly the whole of the ornamental carvings
have been wrought from moulds and replaced in the precise situations of the ancient
sculpture whence they were taken. The whole screen is lofty, and the general
composition of it is divided into three stories in height and as many partitions in
breadth. In the centre of the lowest story is a space for the altar, with three tall
tablets and canopies above; and on each side is a door with a depressed pointed
arch. On each side of the doorways is a niche rising from the ground, flanked by
slender buttresses and covered with a triangular tabernacle of two canopied arches,
with the angular point in front. In each niche is a tall pedestal with a richly carved
head; and above the doors are short double canopies of a similar style, though
rising above those on the sides, and breaking the line of a broad frieze of demi-angels,
above which is a narrow line of carved pelicans, holy lambs, and scrolls.
These terminate the first story; and the above second and third are composed of
a large niche in the centre, with a semi-hexagonal canopy, placed between five
niches on each side, with pedestals and canopies like those below; whilst a second
frieze of angels, etc., parts the two stories. As the story finished the remains of
the ancient screen, Mr. Wallace has designed a termination of an entablature of
angels supporting shields, with a crown-like cornice above; something similar to
which most probably surmounted the original design.” (<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.)</p>

<small>ST. THOMAS’S HOSPITAL</small></h3>


<p>The commonly received opinion as to the Foundation of this Hospital is that it
sprang out of an Almonry belonging to Bermondsey Abbey, founded in 1213 by
Richard, Prior of that House. This statement was made by Stow, and has been
followed by Strype, Maitland, and others; Wilkinson, however, does not agree
with it.</p>

<p>According to Tanner and Dugdale, the Almonry of the Abbey, consisting of
an almshouse for converts and a school for poor boys, was attached to the walls
of the House, was dedicated to St. Thomas of Canterbury, and was under the
government of the Monastery Almoner. This Almonry perished with the Abbey
in the Dissolution, and had nothing to do with the Hospital of St. Thomas.</p>

<p>It is stated by Tanner that after the Fire of 1212, which destroyed the church
of St. Mary Overies together with their Hospital or Almonry, the Prior and
brethren erected a Hospital near their ruins in which they established their church
for a time. When their own House was rebuilt, Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of
Winchester, transferred the Hospital to the other side of the causeway for some
supposed advantages of air. It was built on ground belonging to Amicius, Archdeacon
of Surrey, and dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr. It was always in the
patronage of the Bishop of Winchester. A list of the Masters is preserved.</p>

<p>Stow, however, says that the Hospital was held of the Abbey of Bermondsey,
and that in the year 1428 Thetford, then the Abbot, sold to the Master of the
Hospital the right to keep all the lands belonging to the Abbey and then held by
the Hospital at a small rent.</p>

<p>It is impossible to reconcile these statements unless we suppose that the
Hospital itself, always separate from, and independent of, the Abbey, was occupying
lands of the Abbey of which it desired to keep the control.</p>

<p>On the Dissolution, the House was valued at a yearly income of £309: 1: 11
clear; it had a Master, Brethren, three lay sisters, and made up forty aids for the
sick with food and firing.</p>

<p>In 1552 the City bought the House of Edward the Sixth and opened it again
as a Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>The place has little history. The brethren had at their gates the right of
market for corn and other commodities. The Archdeacon of Surrey, in 1238, had
a hall, a chapel, a stable, and a residence in the Hospital. The Bishops of
Winchester claimed the right of visitation, which was exercised on more than one
occasion.</p>

<p>The old buildings continued until the close of the seventeenth century, when
they were taken down and the Hospital was erected in their place. This House
remained until it became necessary to destroy it, in order to make way for the
railway station and extension on its site. The demolition of old St. Thomas’s
is one of the few acts of destruction which one can regard with satisfaction. For
the removal of the Hospital to the crowded streets of Lambeth, leaving Guy’s for
the eastern part of South London, was unquestionably a great gain to the former,
and no loss to the latter, which is fully served by Guy’s.</p>

<small>ST. GILES-IN-THE-FIELDS</small></h3>


<p>The Hospital known as <em>St. Giles-in-the-Fields</em> was founded by Maud, Queen of
Henry the First, about the year 1117. It was a large foundation, designed for forty
lepers, the Master, Chaplains, Matrons, and servants.</p>

<p>The original endowment was only £3 a year, which, even in the twelfth
century, would not go far towards the support of forty lepers. It appears, however,
as if the custom of lepers going about begging with a bowl and a clapper was
considered the right thing, because it is said that the Proctor of the House went
begging for the lepers. Probably those who could crawl were allowed at the outset
to beg for themselves.</p>

<p>But other benefactions fell in. The lepers obtained rents and lands at
Isleworth, St. Clement Danes, and round their own house; they also obtained the
manor of Feltham in Middlesex; Henry the Second gave them lands at Heston;
people left them houses in London; the House became wealthy.</p>

<p>There were many dissensions and disputes as to the rule and management of
this House. They were finally terminated by Edward the Third, who placed it
under the authority of the House of Burton Lazars, the central Leper Hospital of
England.</p>

<p>The area covered by the ground of the Hospital consisted of eight acres, which
was afterwards largely increased. The Hospital buildings were situated near to the
present church on the west of it; they were surrounded by a triangular wall running
along Crown Street (formerly Hog Lane), High Street, and Monmouth Street. At
the lower end of what is now the Tottenham Court Road on the west side of it was
the Pound: when the gallows was removed from the Elms at Smithfield, it was set
up at the north end of the Hospital enclosure opposite to the Pound. On the same
spot Sir John Oldcastle had been slowly roasted to death some years earlier.</p>

<p>Criminals in later times, on their way to Tyburn, stopped at St. Giles, there to
take their last draught of ale at a tavern named The Bowl.</p>

<p>The lazar houses were probably all governed by similar laws and regulations.
Those of Sherburn, near Durham, will stand, therefore, for many others. The house
was dedicated to Christ, the Blessed Virgin, Lazarus, and his sisters Martha and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Mary. The lepers were under the rule of a steward; there were three priests and
four clerks, of whom one was a deacon. During Lent and Advent all the brethren
had to receive corporal discipline three times a week in the chapel, and the sisters
in like manner in presence of their prioress. Why lepers should be flogged more
than ordinary people is not apparent. Perhaps there was some feeling that a loathsome
and incurable disease argued the wrath of the Almighty on account of some
great crime. The daily allowance of food to the lepers was as follows:—A loaf
and a gallon of ale to each; one mess of flesh between two for three days in the
week; or of fish, cheese, or butter, on the remaining four; on high festivals a
double mess; on St. Cuthbert’s Day, fresh salmon; on Michaelmas Day, four
messed on one goose. The dress of lepers generally consisted of a grey gown with
a hood, and each one carried a basin and a wooden clapper.</p>

<small>ST. HELEN’S</small></h3>


<p>The foundation of this House of Benedictine Nuns was in or about the year 1212,
when Alardus de Burnham, who died in 1216, was Dean of St. Paul’s. The right,
or permission, to found the House is contained in a deed still preserved.</p>

<p>The seal of the convent represents the finding of the Cross by St. Helen: she
stands beside the Cross, holding in her hand the three nails, while a crowd of nuns
are on their knees with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>In 1439 the then Dean, Reynold Kentwode, drew up a new set of Rules for the
use of the Sisters. The following are the principal clauses:—</p>

<p>“‘Reynold Kentwode, Dean and Chapeter of the Church of Poules, to the

<p>At the Dissolution the revenues of this House were valued, according to
Dugdale, at £314: 12: 5, and according to Speed at £376: 6s.</p>

<p>The site and the church were given to Cromwell. Edward the Sixth gave the
advowson to the Bishop of London, but it has since returned to the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>The buildings were purchased by the Leathersellers’ Company, who converted
the Nuns’ Hall into their Common Hall, and so it continued until the demolition of
all the ancient buildings in 1799.</p>

<p>It appears from Malcolm that he believed the Nuns’ Hall to have been
demolished, and a new hall built in 1567. These are his words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We will suppose the monastery of St. Helen demolished, the materials disposed of, and the
purchase of the site compleated by the Company. The architect finds a foundation far superior to any
their funds would supply, and therefore cases the basement walls with brick, and makes the pavement
(ready for his purpose) serve as the floor for the new Hall. And thus far he acted wisely; for his work of
1567 became too ruinous and expensive for repair in 1797, was taken down, and will be forgotten. What
remains to be said of the antient crypt? That it would not have required repair for 500 years to come.
Had the enormous masses of fungous webs, which depended from the arches of this beautiful work,
been carefully swept away, and the walls rubbed with a dry broom, the antient windows re-opened, the
earth that clogged the pavement removed, and its other defilements cleared off, these crypts, now
scattered in piles of rubbish, would have formed a church how infinitely superior to forty I could name!</p>

<p>The regret with which I saw those slender pillars torn from their bases, and the strong though
delicate arches sundered in masses, is still warm to my remembrance. The angles were filled with white
sand, a layer of earth, another of sand, a layer of oak chips; one now lays before me. Six hundred years
have passed since this wood was cut, and the mark of the axe is fresh upon it, and so on till the spaces
were filled.” (Vol. iii. pp. 562-563.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The representation of the hall given by Wilkinson and that given by Malcolm
do not seem to agree in all particulars.</p>

<p>Malcolm adds a view not presented by Wilkinson showing the ruins of the
cloisters.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere called attention to the remarkable fact that London possessed,
down to the end of the eighteenth century, a greater collection of mediæval ruins
than any city of Europe, and that no one, poet, historian, antiquary, essayist, took
the least notice of them. Wilkinson, however, does remark that the group of ruins
“reminds us rather of some romantic fragment of antiquity to be found in distant
countries than of one situated in the very centre of populous London, and were it
not for the modern buildings made out in the background, a spectator might be led
to imagine the scene many miles distant from the Metropolis of England.”</p>

<p>This House of Benedictine Nuns pursued its uneventful course for more than
three hundred years. Now and then the nuns stopped a lane across their property,
or they let their land at long leases, or they inherited new lands, or they mismanaged
and wasted their property, or they buried a Prioress and had to elect another. Very
little else can be recorded of them. It was on this land that Crosby House was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
built on a ninety-nine years’ lease. Meantime, the church of St. Helen’s did duty
both for the nuns and for the parish.</p>

<p>In the year 1534 the value of the House was estimated at £376: 6s. a year.
The property of the nuns shows that this House was always exclusively a London
Foundation. They had houses in the City, in Middlesex, Kent, Essex, Hertford,
and Buckingham—but these were all home counties. In the country they held little,
if any, property.</p>

1799. The site is occupied by the buildings now forming St. Helen’s Place.<br />
<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>
<p>The collection of facts concerning the last years of the nunnery, made by the
late Rev. Thomas Hugo, throws considerable light on the position of the House.</p>

<p>In the first place, the names of the successive Prioresses and those of the
Sisters seem to be chiefly of London origin; secondly, the bequests recorded in the
<cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>, twenty-seven in number, are all made by London citizens.
They are, moreover, situated in various wards, showing that the House was
regarded as belonging to the whole of the City, and not to any part of it. Some of
the bequests are made without any specified purpose; some have conditions and
duties attached; thus, one is for providing communion wine, while others are to be
accompanied by permission of burial in the church.</p>

<p>In reading the disposition and management of their property by the nuns, one
cannot avoid the suspicion that they were sometimes under the influence of certain
persons not wholly disinterested. Thus, there was one Richard Berde, citizen and
girdler. He first takes over a tenement in the parish of St. Ethelburga belonging
to the House for a term of forty years at the rent of 20s. He then takes another
tenement in the same parish for sixty years at 45s. a year. Then he becomes
tenant to the Sisters for the great messuage, or inn, called the “Black Bull,” with
cellars, etc., and two adjoining tenements for one-and-twenty years at a rent of
£9: 14s. a year. So that he became the holder on long leases of one great house
and four tenements. It is perfectly certain, of course, that he intended to sublet
them all at a profit to himself, and that the Sisters in this transaction got the worst
of it. But Richard Berde got more than this out of the nuns: they made him their
seneschal, receiver and collector, with a salary of £12, the annual sum of 20s. for his
livery, board and lodging, with allowances of beer and wine, an allowance of fuel, and
the free use of a chamber and a parlour. The Dissolution must have been a heavy
blow to good Richard Berde: he lost his salary and his allowances; one supposes
that he was still allowed to retain his tenancy of the houses. He received a pension
of 40s., but what was that compared with the extremely comfortable little job that
was taken away?</p>

<p>The name of the last Prioress was Mary Rollesley. What relative was this
lady to John Rollesley, gentleman? One asks because John Rollesley seems
to have done pretty well with the Sisters, too. He got the manor of Burston
from them on a lease for eighty years at a rent of £9. And the year after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
this concession, he obtained a messuage in the Close of St. Helen’s, which
must have been a great house, because it had been occupied by the Bishop of
Llandaff, on a lease of fourscore years at a rent of 46s. 8d. More than that,
he obtained the lease, for the same time, of ten tenements, also in St. Helen’s
Close, at a yearly rent of £15. And on the same day he got two more tenements
outside the Close and a marsh at Stebenhithe (Stepney) for a term of sixty years at
a rent of £8: 15: 4. Two years later the grateful nuns gave John Rollesley a small
pension of four marks a year for good counsel, and Edward Rollesley, gentleman—clearly
one of the same family,—received an annuity of 40s. also for good counsel.
One of the last acts of the last Prioress was to leave to John Rollesley the manor
of Marke, in the parish of Leyton and Walthamstow, for fourscore years at a rent of
£8. Probably all the estates of the House were let in this way to men who farmed
them, making their profit by subletting them. These facts show how lucky it might
be, in the blessed and religious days before the Reformation, for a family to have a
Prioress among them.</p>

</div>

<p>We note, further, that the nuns paid a chief steward, a receiver, and an auditor;
that they paid pension to three chantry chaplains; and yearly payments to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
church wardens of St. Mary Bothaw, to the wardens of a fraternity in Bow Church,
to the Bishop of Lincoln for procurations, etc., to the Abbess of Barking, and annual
doles to the poor on certain days. All these facts, taken together, seem to throw
unexpected light upon the ramifications and divisions of ecclesiastical property.</p>

<p>The nuns were dispersed in 1538. Eighteen years later, in 1556, a list of the
survivors shows that the last Prioress, Mary Rollesley, and six sisters, still survived.
Of these six sisters, five received a pension of £2: 13: 4, and one, who had probably
held some conventual post, received a pension of £3: 6: 8. At the Dissolution
there were two Chantry Priests who had stipends of £8 and £7 respectively.</p>

<p>A considerable part of the ruins of this House was standing until the end of the
eighteenth century. Wilkinson has figured some of the details. The following
description is from the Survey of the King’s Offices, taken when the nuns left it
(<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xvi. 1806):—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>
<p>“<em>The late Priorye of Saint Elenes within the Citye of London.</em></p>

<p>The View and Surveye ther taken the xxith daye of June, in the xxxiij Yeare
of the raigne of our Soveraigne Lord Kinge Henrye the viijth, by Thomas Mildmay,
one of the King’s Auditors thereunto assigned. That is to saye,</p>

<p>Fyrste, the cheaf entre or cominge into the same late Priory ys in and by the

house, larder houses, and other howses of office, apperteninge to the same: and at

howses, pticons, and gardens, within the same Woodyerd a tenement with a
garden, a stable, and other thapptances to the same belonginge, called Elizabeth
Hawtes lodginge.”</p>

<p>Ogilby’s map (see end of <cite>London in the Time of the Stuarts</cite>) shows the site as it
was a hundred years later. There is part of the cloister left, part of the nuns’
garden. As for limits in 1542, the southern boundary of the Nunnery was the
partition wall dividing the church of St. Helen’s; the eastern boundary was St. Mary
Axe, or perhaps a row of houses on the west side; the western boundary was
Bishopsgate Street within, and the northern was Camomile Street, or London Wall,
unless there was a row of houses on its south side.</p>

<p>I have before me a voluminous mass of MS. notes referring to this
important London House. Most of the notes are of small importance. It must,
however, be acknowledged that the chronicles of the House show, perhaps, more
quarrels than we find in the monasteries of men.</p>

<p>In 1432 the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s issue ordinances for the Reformation
of the Convent. A little earlier the same body excommunicate a certain Jowsa
or Joyssa who, after taking the veil as a professed nun of St. Helen’s, left the House
and contracted marriage. About the same time there was a scandal concerning the
treatment of Joan Heyron, one of the nuns, by the Prioress. Joan had gout in her
hands and feet so badly that she could not perform her canonical duties. The
Prioress, probably thinking that Joan was shamming, had, therefore, put her in
prison, from which the Dean of St. Paul’s ordered her release, and the Pope—no
less an authority—gave instructions for her maintenance. This little anecdote
opens the door for speculation of a very interesting kind as to the Row Royal which
should demand the intervention of the Dean first, and an appeal to the Pope afterwards.
One understands, for instance, that Joan Heyron was a Londoner by birth,
that she had relations of influence, and that they were not going to stand it. We
find the admission of Chantry priests by bequest; petitions to elect a prioress in
the room of the late sister deceased; grants of tenements; petitions for a market;
and so on.</p>

<small>ST. MARY SPITAL</small></h3>


<p>Outside Bishopsgate, on the site now occupied by Spital Square, stood that most
venerable and most beneficent House called <i lang="la">Domus Dei</i>, or <i lang="la">Domus Beatæ Mariæ</i>.
It was founded by Walter Brune and Rosia his wife, for Canons Regular, in the
year 1197. Walter, Archdeacon of London, laid the foundation stone, and William,
Bishop of London, dedicated it to Jesus Christ and His Mother, by the name of
<i lang="la">Domus Dei et Beatæ Mariæ extra Bishopsgate</i>. The place carried on a blameless
and most useful existence for three hundred and fifty years. When it was dissolved
it was found to contain no fewer than a hundred and eighty beds for the sick poor.
Now beds were not considered as intended for one person only, but for as many
as, in case of need, could be crammed in, so we may reckon that at least three
hundred and sixty poor persons were always received and treated in this House.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the House are laid down by Stow:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Bounds whereof, as appeareth by Composition betwixt the Parson and Prior of the said
Hospital, concerning Tythes, begin at Berward’s Lane, toward the South, and extend, in Breadth, to the
Parish of St. Leonard, Soresditch, towards the North; and, in Length, from the King’s Street, on the
West, to the Bishop of London’s Field, called Lollesworth, on the East. The Prior of this St. Mary
Spittle, for the Emortising and Appropriation of the Priory of Bikenacar, in Essex, to his said House of
St. Mary Spittle, gave to Henry the Seventh £400, in the 22nd Year of his Reign.</p>

<p>This Hospital, surrendered to Henry the Eighth, was valued to expend £478 wherein, besides
Ornaments of the Church, and other Goods pertaining to the Hospital, there were found standing one
Hundred and eighty Beds well furnished, for receipt of the Poor of Charity; for it was an Hospital of
great Relief....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>“A part of the large Churchyard pertaining to this Hospital, and severed from the rest with a Brick
Wall, yet remaineth as of old time, with a Pulpit Cross therein, somewhat like to that in Paul’s Churchyard.
And against the said Pulpit on the South Side before the Charnel and Chapel of St. Edmond the
Bishop, and Mary Magdalen (which Chapel was founded about the Year 1391 by W. Evesham, Citizen
and Pepperer of London, who was there buried), remaineth also one fair builded House of two Stories in
height for the Maior, and other honourable Persons, with the Aldermen and Sheriffs to sit in, there to
hear the Sermons preached upon Easter Holidays. In the Loft over them stood the Bishop of London,
and other Prelates; now the Ladies and Aldermen’s Wives do there stand at a fair Window, or sit at their
Pleasure.</p>

<p>And here it is to be noted, that time out of mind it hath been a laudable Custom, that on Good
Friday in the Afternoon, some especial learned Man, by Appointment of the Prelates, doth preach a Sermon
at Paul’s Cross, treating of Christ’s Passion: and upon the three next Easter Holidays, Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday, the like learned Men, by the like Appointment, do use to preach on the Forenoon at the
said Spittle, to persuade the Articles of Christ’s Resurrection: and then on Low Sunday, before Noon, one
other learned Man at Paul’s Cross is to make Rehearsal of those four former Sermons, either commending
or reproving them, as to him (by Judgment of the learned Divines) is thought convenient. And that
done, he is to make a Sermon of himself, which in all were five Sermons in one. At these Sermons so
severally preached, the Maior with his brethren and Aldermen are accustomed to be present in their
Violets at Paul’s on Good Friday; and in their Scarlets, both they and their Wives, at the Spittle in the
Holidays, except Wednesday, in Violet: and the Maior with his Brethren on Low Sunday in Scarlet at
Paul’s Cross, continued until this Day.</p>

<p>Touching the Antiquity of this Custom, I find none other than that in the Year 1398. King
Richard having procured from Rome Confirmation of such Statutes and Ordinances as were made in the
Parliament begun at Westminster, and ended at Shrewsbury, he caused the same Confirmation to be read
and pronounced at Paul’s Cross and at St. Mary Spittle, in the Sermons before all the People. Philip
Malpas, one of the Sheriffs in the Year 1439 the 18th of Henry VII. gave 20s. by the Year to the
three Preachers at the Spittle. Stephen Forster, Maior in the Year 1454 gave 40l. to the Preachers of
Paul’s Cross and Spittle. I find also, that the aforesaid House, wherein the Maior and Aldermen do sit
at the Spittle, was builded (for that purpose) of the Goods, and by the Executors of Rich. Rawson, Alderman,
and Isabel his Wife, in the year 1488. In the year 1594 this Pulpit being old, was taken down, and
a new one set up, the Preacher’s Face turned towards the South, which was before toward the West.
Also a large house (on the East side of the said Pulpit) was then builded, for the Governors and
Children of Christ’s Hospital to sit in: and this was done of the Goods of William Elkins, Alderman, late
deceased. But within the first Year, the same House decaying, and like to have fallen, was again (with
great cost) repaired at the City’s charge.” (<cite>Survey</cite>, vol. i)</p></blockquote>

<p>In Spital Square, Bishopsgate Street Without, we have the site of the cloisters,
or perhaps the outer court of the House of St. Mary Spital. At the Suppression
its income was £478; and it contained one hundred and eighty hospital beds. This
means that the hospital contained accommodation, according to the meaning of the
word at the time, for four or five hundred patients. On an estimate of maintenance
at £5 a head, one asks with wonder how all these beds were kept up, and whether
the Hospital depended partly on voluntary donations. The Hospital of St.
Bartholomew, we know, sent its people to beg meat in the Shambles; did St. Mary’s
also send men on the same quest?</p>

<p>One custom survived the House—that of the Easter sermons. It was the
rule that on Good Friday, in the afternoon, some learned man, by appointment of
the Bishop, should preach a sermon at Paul’s Cross on the Passion; that on the three
Easter Holidays, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, other learned men should
preach in the forenoon at the Spital Cross on the subject of the Resurrection; and
that on Low Sunday another learned man should “make rehearsal” at Paul’s Cross
of these four sermons, either commending or reproving them. This was surely the
one single function in the whole of Christendom in which one preacher was ever
invited to criticise publicly the sermons of four other preachers. These sermons
were of great antiquity. In the year 1398 Richard the Second made use of them
for the publication or the confirming of certain statutes by the Pope. In 1439
Philip Malpas, sheriff, gave twenty shillings annually; in 1454 Stephen Forster gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
forty pounds for the preachers; the “house” in which the Mayor and Aldermen,
with their wives, sat to hear the sermon at St. Mary Spital, was a kind of double
gallery open in front. If the Mayor and Aldermen wore their violet cloaks on Good
Friday; their scarlet on Monday and Tuesday at the Spital; their violet on
Wednesday; and their scarlet on Low Sunday, as Stow says, the sermons of St.
Mary Spital must have been very gorgeous and ceremonial functions.</p>

<p>This is what the <cite>London Citizen</cite> (see <cite>Collections of a London Citizen</cite>) says
of the House:—</p>

<p>“A chyrche of Owre Lady that ys namyde Bedlem. And yn that place ben
founde many men that ben fallyn owte of hyr wytte. And fulle honestely they
ben kepte in that place: and sum ben restoryde unto hyr wytte and helthe agayne.
And sum ben a-bydyng there yn for evyr, for they ben falle soo moche owte of
hem selfe that hyt ye uncurerabylle unto man. And unto that place ys grauntyde
moche pardon, more thenne they of the place knowe.”</p>

<p>This Priory continued for nearly three hundred years, during which period
it never obtained any popularity or any substantial increase to its revenues. On
searching the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>, we find a few bequests left to the House until
1411. After this date there is no more mention of the House.</p>

<p>Then poverty fell upon it: it received permission to beg for alms; and the
Brethren—were there ever any sisters?—as they died were not replaced; between
the years 1411 and 1538—that is, for a hundred and twenty-seven years—there
is a dead silence in the Wills. We know that there was a chantry here for Lord
Basset, who was a benefactor; and we know that Henry the Fourth appointed
in 1423 one Robert Dale, and in 1471, one Richard Sneeth as Prior or warden.
The House was probably the most conspicuous case in London of a Foundation
of which only the shell was left. Its endowments gone, the “special devotion”
of the Founder to the Church of Bethlehem no longer understood, the respect for
the sacred site of Bethlehem a thing decaying, and, at last, the very Brethren
gone. At the Dissolution one man was found in the House, the Master, and he
had left off wearing the habit of the Order. Was he quite poor? Did he live
alone in the place wandering about the ghostly cloister, singing matins at midnight
alone in the mouldering chapel, the roof of which was falling off? Or cultivating
the little garden beside the City Ditch for vegetables and roots which formed most
of his food? Strange life! Or were the revenues large enough to keep him in
comfort with servants to attend upon him, so that he lived in semi-ecclesiastic
guise?</p>

<p>There is some obscurity about the conversion of the House into an Asylum
for persons of unsound mind. Stow says that it became an asylum, but does not
give the date. Newcourt says, that “sometime, a King of England”—which is
vague—disliking the presence near the Court of the Lunatic Asylum which stood
at Charing Cross, ordered the removal of the inmates to Bethlehem, which would
show that the place had fallen into decay some time before the Dissolution. In
the year 1523 one Stephen Jennings gave £40 towards the purchase of the
patronage of the House, and the Mayor took steps toward carrying out this object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
when the Dissolution happened, and the place, whose surrender value is not stated,
went to the King. The mad people were turned adrift; one knows not where
they went or how they fared: in 1546, however, the King gave the House to the
City, and the Mayor bought the patronage and houses and tenements belonging to
it and replaced the lunatics.</p>

<p>The church was taken down in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It does not
appear that the House had any property, because the patients were maintained
by their friends, or if these were too poor, by a charge upon the parish. There
was accommodation for sixty patients. Five years after the King’s gift, license
was granted to John Whitehead, proctor of the House, to ask for alms in the
dioceses of London, Ely, and Lincoln.</p>

<small>THE CLARES</small></h3>


<p>The Abbey of St. Clare, which stood on the site of the church called Holy Trinity,
Minories, was founded by Blanche d’Artois in 1293. The following genealogy
sufficiently explains the connection of Blanche with this country and with London:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_329.jpg"  alt="Genealogical tree" />
<p class="center small">A tabular version is available <a href="#table_1">here</a>.</p>
</div>


<p>The House was founded in 1293 for the reception of “certain nuns devoted
to the service of God, St. Mary and St. Francis, expected shortly to arrive and to
settle in this realm.” The first nuns were Frenchwomen, brought over by Blanche.
They belonged to the Order called Clares, their name being that of St. Clare, the
foundress of the Franciscan nuns, who was canonised in 1253, two years after her
death. They called themselves <i lang="la">Sorores Minores</i>—as their Franciscan Friars were
<i lang="la">Fratres Minores</i>; they were also called “rich Clares,” because they were allowed
to possess endowments and lands; others of the same Order being “poor Clares,”
who subsisted entirely on the charity of the people. They were also called
Urbanists, because their rule had been revised by Pope Urban; and they were
<i lang="la">inclusæ</i>, that is to say, forbidden, except by reason of pestilence, war, or fire, to
go outside the convent walls.</p>

<p>The endowments began with three tenements and four parcels of ground near,
or upon, the site of the House, together with some houses in West Chepe, yielding
£30 a year.</p>

<p>Subsequent endowments included a large number of messuages, tenements,
wharves, and shops in London and Whitechapel. It would be interesting to
ascertain how much of London actually belonged to the Religious Houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>The infant Convent received three Bulls from Pope Boniface VIII. In the
first he received the House, with all its buildings and property, under his own
peculiar jurisdiction. In the second he declared the House free from the jurisdiction
of the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the third
he pronounced the House inviolable, and ordered the Bishop of London to
consecrate for the nuns all the Church plate and sacred vessels.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward the Second the King exempted the sisters, on account
of their poverty, from all tallage payable to the Crown for their lands and houses
in London.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward the Third they obtained a grant of thirty marks a
year, and another of twenty marks from private persons. They also obtained from
Isabella, mother of Edward the Third, the advowsons of three churches, on the
condition of praying for the soul of the late King. Edward the Third also endowed
them with lands and houses.</p>

<p>The writer of a paper in <cite>Archæologia</cite> enumerates many gifts of messuages, etc.,
made to the sisters during the two hundred and fifty years of their existence. In
the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> between 1341 and 1519, I find twenty-five bequests to this
House, of which all but seven belong to the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>A considerable mass of ruins of the Convent House remained standing down
to the end of the eighteenth century, when most of them were destroyed. In 1706
it was found that the north wall of the present church of the Holy Trinity was
part of the wall of the Sisters’ Chapel; in 1793, in digging the foundations of a house,
in Haydon Square, a massive stone wall was discovered, certainly part of the House,
as it formed the boundary of the parish. On the west side of the Square the
houses in 1803 were part of the original building, the walls being of stone, even the
partitions between the rooms. In 1797 a fire, which consumed many of the houses
south of the church, from the Minories to Haydon Square, eastward, laid open the
remains of a Hall which seemed to be the Refectory.</p>

<p>Stow has the following particulars concerning this House:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“The License for founding it bore Date 21 <b>E. I.</b> to the Abbess of St. Clare without Aldgate. There
was a Charter granted 9 E. II. that the Sisters Minoresses without Aldgate should be quit of Tallage on
account of their Lands and Tenements in the City of London. In another Charter 14 <b>E. II.</b> it is called
the Abby of the Minoresses of St. Mary of the Order of St. Clare without the Walls of the City: In which
Charter are confirmed certain Messes of theirs in the Vintry, in Wood Street, Lad Lane, Old Fish Street,
and one Mess and two Shops in Lombard Street, Christ’s Church Lane, and Shirburgh Lane; gotten of
divers well affected Persons: What the Charters and Liberties of these Minoresses were, may be seen by
the Confirmation thereof in 1 H. V. and Anno 16 and 25 and 2 H. 4, which remain in the Tower
Records. The Manour of Apeldercome was granted to the Prioress of the Minoresses without Aldgate,
1 H. IV. and 22 H. VI. A Mess called the Herteshorn, in the Parish of St. Mary Matfelon, was granted
to them by Nicholas Walshe, 7 E. IV. To all the rest let this be added.</p>

<p>That this House was first erected to receive Nuns that were to be brought over by Blanch, Queen of
Navarre, Wife to the abovesaid Earl Edmund: And they were professed to serve God, the blessed Virgin,
and St. Francis; as appears by this Charter of Licence, which the said Edmund obtained of the King his
Brother the 21st of his Reign.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The House attracted and maintained the greatest respect of the citizens.
This is shown by the bequests which were showered upon the sisterhood; these
were continued far into the fifteenth century, long after the stream of benefactions
had ceased for the other religious houses of London. It is also shown by the
request of many ladies that they should be buried in the Chapel of the Nuns—among
them was Elizabeth, Duchess of Norfolk, who died in 1506, only thirty years
before the Dissolution. It has already been noticed in another place that there is
nowhere to be found any scandal, or suggestion of scandal, concerning the Religious
women of the London Houses.</p>

<p>The House has no history. For two hundred and fifty years the sisters
carried on their quiet lives; they produced no saint; they enjoyed no ecstatic
visions; they obeyed the Rule with such modifications as were introduced from
time to time; their lives were monotonous, but they had their little distractions.
One event alone is recorded of them—the plague of 1515—when within these
walls alone twenty-seven of the sisters were carried off, besides the lay sisters and
the servants.</p>

<p>At their dissolution their income amounted to £318: 16: 5. If we consider
that the stipend of a Chantry Priest was no more than £6 or £7 a year, on which
he could live, we may multiply this income by ten at least, and we may conclude that
the number of sisters, making allowance for the maintenance of the House, was not
more than thirty, and perhaps less, the tendency in the latter days, when there
were few bequests, being to keep down the number of the sisterhood, therefore
they were well off.</p>

<p>The Clares were not included in Cardinal Wolsey’s first suppression of the
smaller Houses of 1528, nor in that of 1536. The Abbess, however, Lady Elizabeth
Savage, resigned her charge in 1538, the year before the final Act was passed.</p>

<p>For two years the place remained empty and deserted. In 1540 however,
the King granted the House to the See of Bath and Wells for a London residence.
The Bishop at that time was John Clarke, a man whose share in the momentous
events of the day has somehow been passed over by historians.</p>

<p>He was born about the year 1480; he took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. at
Cambridge; he studied law at Bologna; he took Holy Orders and received many
benefices, including the Mastership of the Maison Dieu at Dover. Since these
preferments were scattered about in many counties, it is evident that he performed
none of the duties. He was otherwise occupied. In 1519 he was sent by the
King with a message to Louise of Savoy; he was made Archdeacon of Colchester,
Dean of Windsor, Judge of the Court of the Star Chamber; and he was charged
in 1521 with the presentation of King Henry’s work against Luther. He remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
at Rome as the King’s Ambassador and the servant of Wolsey for four years;
he was employed in an embassy to the Court of France, and was sent a second
time to Rome. He returned with Cardinal Campeggio. By this time he had been
promoted to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells.</p>

<p>He did not long enjoy his London residence. In the same year in which
he received the gift, he was sent on an embassy to the Duke of Cleves, and, with
his servants, was poisoned. He came back to die in January 1541, and was buried
in the Chapel of the Clares.</p>

<p>The House was once more taken over by the Crown, being exchanged by
Bishop Barber for other property in 1548. Edward granted it to the Duke of
Suffolk in 1552. It does not appear, however, that Lady Jane Grey, his daughter,
was ever resident at the House of the Clares. The Duke was executed on the
23rd of February 1554. We may believe that some of the old sanctity was still
lingering about the Chapel of the vanished nuns. There is some reason to believe
that the head of the Duke was brought to the Chapel and buried before the altar.
In 1852 the then Earl of Dartmouth was inspecting the vaults under the modern
church, where some of his ancestors are buried. He came upon something that
might have been a basket full of sawdust. On examination there was found to be
a head well preserved, with the marks of decapitation on the neck. The features
resembled those of the beheaded Duke, and it seems probable that either by his
own request, or by the pious care of a servant, the head was brought here to be laid
in the Duke’s own Chapel, the former Chapel of the <i lang="la">Sorores Minores Inclusæ</i>.</p>

<p>After the accession of Queen Elizabeth, the Precincts of the Abbey remained,
like many other Precincts, a quiet place, in whose Close houses were built. The
church was granted to the people of the place on the condition of their maintaining
a minister for the parish, which occupied exactly the same site as the former Abbey.</p>

<p>It was a small parish, no more than 255 feet in length, facing the City Wall.
The old buildings were gradually pulled down, and the materials used for the new
houses, but enough remained, even as late as the end of the eighteenth century,
to form a picturesque collection of ruins. A fire in 1767 destroyed most of the
buildings. As to the church, it became that of the Holy Trinity; it was repaired
in 1618, in 1624, in 1636; it escaped the Fire of London. But most unfortunately
it was taken down in 1740—with the exception of the north Wall—and rebuilt a
mean and poor little church, which will remain standing as a Church House while
the Parish, consisting of Haydon Green and little else, has been absorbed in that
of St. Botolph, Aldgate. The new church contained something of the old chapel:
the font, the reredos, the pavement before the altar, the monuments which were
put up on the north wall. The church plate is also rich and curious. The charities
are very small, amounting to no more than £13 a year in all.</p>

<p>The church was at one time—about the close of the seventeenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>—
a favourite place for weddings. In 1697 there were 956; sometimes there were
six, eight, or ten weddings in one day. The reason seems to have been that the
church claimed to be a peculiar, and exempt from the visitation of the ordinary,
therefore licenses were not required for this church any more than for St. James’s,
Duke Place, or the Fleet, or May Fair.</p>

<p>A Roman sarcophagus, discovered within this parish, is now preserved in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>The church is much richer in associations than would be expected from its
outward appearance. There is a brass to Constance Lucy, one of the well-known
Lucy family; there is the tomb of Sir John Pelham and his son; there are buried
here the first Lord Dartmouth, son of Colonel William Legge, and thirty-two of
his descendants; there is a portrait of Sir Isaac Newton, with the tradition that he
once lived in Haydon Square and worshipped in this church; Miles Coverdale
preached here, as the historian of the church, Dr. Kinns found, on eleven occasions.
The tomb of Colonel William Legge, who lived in the Abbey, bears his shield, on
which are impaled the arms of the Washington family, with the stars and stripes
which are the origin of the American flag. The connection of the Washingtons
and the Legges is given by Dr. Kinns in the following pedigree:—</p>

<small>ST. KATHERINE’S BY THE TOWER</small></h3>


<p>On the 30th day of October, in the year of grace one thousand eight hundred and
twenty-five, there was gathered together a congregation to assist at the mournfullest
service ever heard in any church. The place was the Precinct of St. Katherine’s,
the church was that known as St. Katherine’s by the Tower—the most ancient and
venerable church in the whole of East London—a city which now has but two
ancient churches left, those of Bow and of Stepney, without counting the old tower
of Hackney.</p>

<p>Suppose it was advertised that the last and the farewell service, before the
demolition of the Abbey, would be held at Westminster on a certain day; that after
the service the old church would be pulled down; that some of the monuments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
would be removed, the rest destroyed; that the bones of the illustrious dead would
be carted away and scattered, and that the site would be occupied by warehouses
used for commercial purposes. One can picture the frantic rage and despair with
which the news would everywhere be received; one can imagine the stirring of the
hearts of all those who in every part of the world inherit the Anglo-Saxon speech;
one can hear the sobbing and the wailing which accompany the last anthem, the last
sermon, the last prayer.</p>

<p>THE GOTHIC ALTAR-PIECE IN THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH OF ST. KATHERINE, WITH THE MONUMENTS OF THE
DUKE OF EXETER AND OF THE HON. G. MONTAGUE
</p></div>
</div>
<p>St. Katherine’s by the Tower was the Abbey of East London: poor and small,
certainly, compared with the Cathedral church of the City and the Abbey of the West,
but stately and ancient; endowed by half a dozen Sovereigns; consecrated by the
memory of seven hundred years, filled with the monuments of great men and small
men buried within her walls; standing in her own Precinct; with her own Courts,
Spiritual and Temporal; with her own judges and officers; surrounded by the
claustral buildings belonging to Master, Brethren, Sisters, and Bedeswomen. The
church and the hospital had long survived the intentions of the founders; yet as
they stood, so situated, so ancient, so venerable, amid a dense population of rough
sailors and sailor folk, with such enormous possibilities for good and useful work,
sacred and secular, one is lost in wonder that the consent of Parliament, even for
purposes of gain, could be obtained for their destruction. Yet St. Katherine’s
was destroyed. When the voice of the preacher died away, the destroyers began
their work. They pulled down the church; they hacked up the monuments, and
dug up the bones; they destroyed the Master’s house, and cut down the trees in his
quiet orchard; they pulled down the Brothers’ houses round the little ancient
square; they pulled down the row of Sisters’ and the Bedeswomen’s houses; they
swept the people out of the Precinct, and destroyed the streets; they pulled down
the Courts, Spiritual and Temporal, and opened the doors of the prison; they
grubbed up the burying-ground. With the bones and the dust of the dead, and
the rubbish of the foundations, they filled up the old reservoir of the Chelsea waterworks,
and enabled Mr. Cubitt to build Eccleston Square. When all was gone
they let the water into the big hole they had made, and called it St. Katherine’s
Dock. All this done, they became aware of certain prickings of conscience. They
had utterly demolished and swept away and destroyed a thing which could never be
replaced; they were fain to do something to appease those prickings. They therefore
stuck up a new chapel, which the architect called Gothic, with six neat houses
in two rows, and a large house with a garden in Regent’s Park, and this they called
St. Katherine’s. “Sirs,” they said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> “it is not true that we have destroyed that
ancient foundation at all; we have only removed it to another place. Behold your
St. Katherine’s!” Of course it is nothing of the kind. It is not St. Katherine’s.
It is a sham, a house of Shams and Shadows.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Hospital dates seven hundred and forty years back, when
Matilda, Stephen’s Queen, founded it for the purpose of having masses said for the
repose of her two children, Baldwin and Matilda. She ordered that the Hospital
should consist of a Master, Brothers, Sisters, and certain poor persons—probably
the same as in the later foundation. She appointed the Prior and Canons of Holy
Trinity to have perpetual custody of the Hospital; and she reserved to herself and
all succeeding Queens of England the nomination of the Master. Her grant was
approved by the King, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope. Shortly
afterwards William of Ypres bestowed the land of Edredeshede, afterwards called
Queenhythe, on the Priory of Holy Trinity, subject to an annual payment of £20
to the Hospital of Katherine’s by the Tower.</p>

<p>This was the original foundation. It was not a Charity; it was a Religious
House with a definite duty—to pray for the souls of two children; it had no other
charitable objects than belong to any religious foundation—viz. the giving of alms
to the poor, nor was it intended as a church for the people; in those days there were
no people outside the Tower, save the inhabitants of a few scattered cottages
along the river wall, and the farmhouses of Stebenhuthe (Stepney). It was simply
founded for the benefit of two little princes’ souls.</p>

<p>The Prior and Canons of Holy Trinity without Aldgate continued to exercise
some authority over the Hospital, but apparently against the protests and grumblings
of the St. Katherine’s Society. It was, however, formally handed over to them, a
hundred and forty years later, by Henry the Third. After his death, Queen Eleanor,
for some reason, now dimly intelligible, wanted to get the Hospital into her own
hands. The Bishop of London took it away from the Priory and transferred it to
her. Then, perhaps with the view of preventing any subsequent claim of the
Priory, she declared the Hospital dissolved.</p>

<p>Here ends the first chapter in the history of the Hospital. The foundation for
the souls of the two princes existed no longer—the children, no doubt, having been
long since sung out of Purgatory. Queen Eleanor, however, immediately refounded
it. The Hospital was, as before, to consist of a Master, three Brothers, three
Sisters, and bedeswomen. It was also provided that six poor scholars were to be
fed and clothed—not educated. The Queen further provided that on November
the 16th of every year twelve pence each should be given to the poor scholars, and
the same amount to twenty-four poor persons; and that on November the 20th,
the anniversary of the King’s death, one thousand poor men should receive one
halfpenny each. Here is the first introduction of a charity. The Hospital is
no longer an ecclesiastical foundation only; it maintains scholars and gives
substantial alms. Who received these alms? Of course the people in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
neighbourhood—if there were no inhabitants in the Precinct, the poor of Portsoken
Ward. In either case the charity would be local—a point of the greatest importance.
Queen Eleanor also continued her predecessor’s rule that the patronage of the
Hospital should remain in the hands of the Queens of England for ever; when there
was no Queen, then in the hands of the Queen Dowager; failing her, in those of
the King. This rule still obtains. The Queen appoints the Master, Brothers,
and Sisters of the House of Shams in Regent’s Park, just as her predecessors
appointed those of St. Katherine’s by the Tower.</p>

<p>Queen Eleanor was followed by other royal benefactors. Edward the Second,
for example, gave the rectory of St. Peter’s in Northampton. Queen Philippa,
who, like Eleanor, regarded the place with especial affection, endowed it with the
manor of Upchurch in Kent, and that of Queenbury in Hertfordshire. She also
founded a chantry with £10 a year for a chaplain. Edward the Third founded
another chantry in honour of Philippa, with a charge of £10 a year upon the
Hanaper Office; he also conferred upon it the right of cutting wood for fuel in the
Forest of Essex. Richard the Second gave it the manor of Reshyndene in Sheppey,
and one hundred and twenty acres of land in Minster. Henry the Sixth gave it the
manors of Chesingbury in Wiltshire, and Quasley in Hants; he also granted a
charter, with the privilege of holding a fair. Lastly, Henry the Eighth founded, in
connection with St. Katherine’s by the Tower, the Guild of St. Barbara, consisting
of a Master, three Wardens, and a great number of members, among whom were
Cardinal Wolsey, the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk, the Duke and Duchess of
Buckingham, the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury, and the Earl and Countess of
Northumberland, with other great and illustrious persons.</p>

<p>This is a goodly list of benefactors. It is evident that St. Katherine’s was
a foundation regarded by the Kings and Queens of England with great favour.
Other benefactors it had, notably John Holland, Duke of Exeter, Lord High Admiral
and Constable of the Tower, himself of royal descent. He was buried in the
church, with his two wives, and bequeathed to the hospital the manor of Much
Gaddesden. He also gave it a cup of beryl, garnished with gold, pearls, and
precious stones, and a chalice of gold for the celebration of the Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>In the year 1546 all the lands belonging to the Hospital were transferred to the
Crown.</p>

<p>At this time the whole revenue of the Hospital was £364: 12: 6, and the
expenditure was £210: 6: 5; the difference being the value of the mastership.
The Master at the dissolution was Gilbert Lathom, a priest, and the brothers were
five in number—namely, the original three, and the two priests for the chantries.
Four of the five had “for his stipend, mete, and drynke, by yere,” the sum of £8,
which is fivepence-farthing a day; the other had £9, which is sixpence a day. It
would be interesting, by comparison of prices, to ascertain how much could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
purchased with sixpence a day. The three sisters had also £8 a year, and the
bedeswomen had each two pounds five shillings and sixpence a year. There were
six scholars at £4 a year each for “their mete, drynke, clothes, and other
necessaries”; and there were four servants, a steward, a butler, a cook, and an
under-cook, who cost £5 a year each. There were two gardens and a yard or
court—namely, the square, bounded by the houses of the brothers, and the church.</p>

<p>This marks the closing of the second chapter in the history of the Hospital.
With the cessation of saying masses for the dead its religious character expired.
There remained only the services in the church for the inhabitants of the Precinct
in the time of Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>The only use of the Hospital was now as a charity. Fortunately the place
was not, like the Priory of the Holy Trinity, granted to a courtier, otherwise it
would have been swept away just as that Priory, or that of Elsing’s Spital, was
swept away. It continued after a while to carry on its existence, but with changes.
It was secularised. The Masters for a hundred and fifty years, not counting the
interval of Queen Mary’s reign, were laymen. The brothers were generally laymen.
The first Master of the third period was Sir Thomas Seymour: he was succeeded
by Sir Francis Flemyng, Lieutenant-General of the King’s Ordnance. Flemyng
was deprived by Queen Mary, who appointed one Francis Mallet, a priest, in his
place. Queen Elizabeth dispossessed Mallet and appointed Thomas Wilson, a layman
and a Doctor at Laws. During his mastership there were no Brothers, and
only a few Sisters or Bedeswomen. The Hospital then became a rich sinecure.
Among the Masters were Sir Julius Cæsar, Master of the Rolls, Sir Robert Acton,
Dr. Coxe; three Montague brothers—Walter, Henry, and George; Lord Brouncker;
the Earl of Feversham; Sir Henry Newton, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty;
the Hon. George Berkeley, and Sir James Butler. The Brothers had been
re-established—their names are enumerated by Ducarel—one or two of them were
clerks in orders, but all the rest were laymen. They still received the old stipend
of £8 a year, with a small house. As for the rest of the greatly increased income, it
went to the Master after the manner common to all the old charities. During the
latter half of the sixteenth and the whole of the seventeenth century, St. Katherine’s
by the Tower consisted of a beautiful old church standing with its buildings
clustered round it—a Master’s house rich in carved and ancient wood-work, with its
gardens and orchards, its houses for the Brothers, Sisters, and Bedeswomen, each
of whom continued to receive the same salary as that ordained by Queen Eleanor.
Service was held in the church for the inhabitants of the Precinct, but the Hospital
was wholly secular. The Master devoured by far the greater part of the revenue,
and the alms-people—Brothers, Sisters, and Bedeswomen—had no duties to perform
of any kind.</p>

<p>In the year 1698 this, the third chapter in the life of the Hospital, was closed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Somers, held in that year a Visitation of the Hospital,
the result of which is interesting because it shows, first, a lingering of the old
ecclesiastical traditions, and, next, the sense that something useful ought to be done
with the income of the Hospital. It was therefore ordered in the new regulations
provided by the Chancellor that the Brothers should be in holy orders, and that a
school of 35 boys and 15 girls should be maintained by the Hospital. It does not
appear that any duties were expected of the Brothers. Like the Fellows of colleges
at Oxford and Cambridge, they were all to be in priests’ orders, and for exactly the
same reason, because at the original foundation of the colleges, as well as of the
Hospital, the Fellows were all priests. As for the Master, he remained a layman.
This new order of things, therefore, raised the position of the Brothers, and gave a
new dignity to the Hospital; further, the School, as well as the Bedeswomen,
defined its position as a Charity. It still fell far, very far, short of what it might
have been, but it was not, between the years 1698 and 1825, quite so useless as
before.</p>

<p>A plan of the Precinct, with drawings of the church, within and without, and of
the monuments in the church, may be found in Lysons. The obscurity of the
Hospital, and the neglect into which it fell during the 18th century, are shown by
the small attention paid to it in the books on London of the 18th century and the
early years of the last century. The Hospital buildings consisted of a square,
of which the north side was occupied by the Master’s house, with a large garden
behind, and the Master’s orchard between his garden and the river; on the east and
west sides were the Brothers’ houses, and on the south side of the square was the
church and the Chapter House. On the east of the church was the burying-ground.
South of the church was the Sisters’ close, with the houses occupied by the Sisters
and the Bedeswomen. The old Brothers’ houses were taken down and rebuilt about
the year 1755, and the Master’s house, an ancient building, full of carved timber
work, had also been taken down, so that in the year 1825, when the Hospital was
finally destroyed, the only venerable building standing in the Precinct was the
church itself. To look at the drawings of this old church, and to think of the loving
care with which it would have been treated had it been allowed to stand till this day,
and then to consider the “Gothic” edifice in Regent’s Park, is indeed saddening.
The church consisted of the nave and chancel, with two aisles built by Bishop Beckington,
formerly the master. The east window, thirty feet high and twenty-five wide, had
once been most beautiful when its windows were stained. The tracery was still
fine; a St. Katherine’s wheel occupied the highest part, and beneath it was a rose;
but none of the windows had preserved their painted glass, so that the general
effect of the interior must have been cold. The carved wood of the stalls, and the
great pulpit presented by Sir Julius Cæsar, may still be seen in the Regent’s Park
Chapel, where are also some of the monuments. Of these the church was full.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
The finest (now in Regent’s Park), was that of John Holland, Duke of Exeter, and
his two wives; there was one of the Hon. George Montague, Master of the
Hospital, who died in the year 1681; and there was the monument with kneeling
figures of one Cutting and his wife, with his coat of arms. The seats of the stalls
are curiously carved, as is often found, with grotesque figures: human birds,
monkeys, lions, boys riding hogs, angels playing bagpipes, beasts with human heads,
pelicans feeding their young, and the devil with hoof and horns carrying off a brace
of souls. There was more than the customary wealth of epitaphs. Thus, on the
tablet to the memory of the daughter of one of the brothers was written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Thus we by want, more than by having, learn</div>
   <div class="verse">The worth of things in which we claim concern.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On that of William Cutting, a benefactor to Gonville and Caius, Cambridge, is
written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Not dead, if good deedes could keep men alive,</div>
   <div class="verse">Nor all dead, since good deedes do men revive.</div>
   <div class="verse">Gunville and Kaies his good deedes maie record,</div>
   <div class="verse">And will (no doubt) him praise therefor afford.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the tablet of Charles Stamford, clergyman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Mille modis morimur mortales, nascimur uno:</div>
   <div class="verse">Sunt hominum morbi mille sed una salus.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And to the memory of Robert Beadles, freemason, one of his Majesty’s gunners
of the Tower, who died in the year 1683:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“He now rests quiet, in his grave secure;</div>
   <div class="verse">Where still the noise of guns he can endure;</div>
   <div class="verse">His martial soul is doubtless now at rest,</div>
   <div class="verse">Who in his lifetime was so oft oppressed</div>
   <div class="verse">With care and fears, and strange cross acts of late,</div>
   <div class="verse">But now is happy and in glorious state.</div>
   <div class="verse">The blustering storm of life with him is o’er,</div>
   <div class="verse">And he is landed on that happy shore</div>
   <div class="verse">Where ’tis that he can hope and fear no more.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There they lay buried, the good people of St. Katherine’s Precinct. They
belonged to all trades, but chiefly to those which necessitate going down to the sea
in ships. On the list of names are those of half a dozen captains, one of them
captain of H.M.S. <i>Monmouth</i>, who died in the year 1706, aged 31 years; there are
the names of lieutenants; there are those of sail-makers and gunners; there is a
sergeant of Admiralty, a moneyer of the Tower, a weaver, a citizen and stationer,
a Dutchman, who fell overboard and was drowned, a surveyor and collector—all the
trades and callings that would gather together in this little riverside district
separated and cut off from the rest of London. Among the people who lived here
were the descendants of them who came away with the English on the taking of
Calais, Guisnes, and Hames. They settled in a street called Hames and Guisnes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Lane, corrupted into Hangman’s Gains. A census taken in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth showed that of those resident in the Precinct 328 were Dutch; 8 were
Danes; 5 were Polanders; 69 were French—all hat-makers—2 Spanish, 1 Italian,
and 12 Scotch. Verstegen, the antiquary, was born here, and here lived Raymond
Lully. During the last century the Precinct came to be inhabited almost entirely
by sailors, belonging to every nation and every religion under the sun.</p>

<p>This was the place which it was permitted to certain promoters of a Dock
Company to destroy utterly. A place with a history of seven hundred years; which
might, had its ecclesiastical character been preserved and developed, have been
converted into a cathedral for East London; or, if its secular character had been
maintained, might have become a noble centre of all kinds of useful work for the
great chaotic city of East London. They suffered it to be destroyed. It has been
destroyed for sixty years. As for calling the place in Regent’s Park St. Katherine’s
Hospital, that, I repeat, is absurd. There is no longer a St. Katherine’s Hospital.</p>

<small>CRUTCHED FRIARS</small></h3>


<p>The Order of Crutched, or Crossed, Friars—“Brethren Crucifer”—was instituted
in the twelfth century. Some came over to England towards the end of
the thirteenth century. Two London citizens, Ralph Hoster and William
Sabernes, being greatly attracted by the sanctity of the Friars, took for them three
tenements at an annual rent of 13s. 4d. of the Holy Trinity Priory, and for themselves
either entered the Order or took up the Fraternity of the Order. Twenty
years later, the Community had obtained enough money to enable them to buy
other houses of the same Priory and to build a convent for themselves. The site
was a piece of ground lying east of Seething Lane. The Friars carried in their
hands a cross, and were also distinguished by wearing a cross of red cloth on their
backs. The House, unlike other Friaries, seems to have held certain lands in
Suffolk and certain Houses in the City: perhaps lands and houses were only
endowments of an obit or an annual remembrance for the donor and his family.
Like all the Friaries, this House was always poor: at the surrender it was valued at
no more than £52: 13: 4. Stow cannot enumerate more than twenty worthies of
London who were buried here. Of these the most important was Sir John
Milbourne, who founded almshouses in the year 1521 for thirteen bedesmen,
who were bound every day to attend the eight o’clock mass at Our Lady’s Altar,
founded by Sir John Milbourne, there to pray for their benefactor’s soul. The
will of the founder illustrates the change which had fallen upon men’s minds.
Milbourne had not got beyond the belief in masses and prayers for the dead; but
he had got beyond the belief in the perfunctory service of a chantry priest; he
would keep poor men past work from want; this would be a more meritorious
work than the endowment of a priest who should have nothing in the world to do
except to say a daily mass; the prayers of a bedesman ought to be at least as
efficacious as those of a paid chantry priest.</p>

<p>The Crutched Friars surrendered in 1539. Their house and estates were
valued at £52: 13: 4, as stated above. The church and buildings were pulled down;
a carpenter’s shop with a tennis-court and other places were built upon its site.
The hall was turned into a glass-house, and thirty-five years after the Dissolution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
was burned down. There were thus no remains or ruins of the House left at all;
unless it were vaults or crypts.</p>

<p>On its site were erected later on the Navy House,—Pepys’s Navy House—and
at the present day an open court, once, probably, the site of the cloister of the Brethren
Crucifer, may still be seen. It now belongs to some Railway Company. First, a
cloister of Friars, then a glass-house and tennis-court, next a Navy Office, and lastly,
Receiving House for a Railway—here is a sequence of uses which Sir John
Milbourne would hardly be able to foresee. After the Dissolution, the place appears
to have attracted many persons as a residence, presumably from the quiet that still
lingered about the Precinct. Here Dr. Turner had his Botanical Garden, one
cannot doubt—on the site of the Monastic Garden. He dedicated his book, <cite>The
New Herbal</cite>, 1568, to Queen Elizabeth, from “my house at London in the Crossed
Fryers.” Dr. White Kennett, Minister of St. Botolph, Aldgate, 1699-1728, lived
in “Crutchet Fryers,” and Pepys’s Diary is, of course, filled with references to the
Navy Office, Crutched Friars.</p>

<small>AUSTIN FRIARS</small></h3>


<p>The House of Austin Friars, <i>i.e.</i> of Friars Eremites of the Order of St. Augustine,
was founded in the year 1253 by Humphrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex,
“to the honour of God, and the Blessed Mother, the Virgin, and for the health of
the souls of himself, his ancestors, and his descendants.” The House was enriched
in 1344 by the munificence of Reginald Cobham, and in the year 1354 the great-grandson
of the founder built the church, of which a portion of the nave still remains.
This Church, one of the noblest in London, possessed a spire, or <i lang="fr">flèche</i>, which, like
that of the Sainte Chapelle of Paris, was the pride and admiration of the whole city.
Like all the churches of the Friaries, it was for many years esteemed a specially
holy place for burial. Among those whose dust lies in this spot are Edmund, first
son of Joan the Fair, mother of Richard the Second; Humphrey Bohun, the
founder; Richard, Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Warren; Sir Francis Courtenay; the
Earl of Pembroke; John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, beheaded 1463; Edward, Duke
of Buckingham, beheaded 1521; many of the Barons slain at Barnet Field; and a
long list of noble knights and dames besides. The Austin Friars came over here in
the year 1251; they found a welcome not only in London, but elsewhere; they had,
for instance, houses at Oxford and many other places. The Augustines turned out
many scholars; among them the principal opponent of Wyclyf. The Order, in fact,
unlike that of St. Francis, was one which professed to cultivate learning. The
monastic dress of an Austin Friar was a long black gown with broad sleeves and
a fine cloth hood; a white habit and scapulary, with a black leathern belt buckled
with ivory.</p>

<p>This was never a rich House, but it always retained a certain steady reputation,
not only as a centre of learning and letters, but also for a more scrupulous enforcement
of discipline than was found among several other branches.</p>

<p>Austin Friars was essentially a London House. Yet it was never so popular
as many other Houses. It appears by an examination of the London Wills that
the Austin Friars were not so much regarded by the citizens as, for instance, the
Grey Friars; or even as some of the smaller Houses such as Elsyng Spital. It
was customary with wealthy and pious persons to leave money to all the orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
of Friars in the City, and even to every Friar individually. The Augustine
Brotherhood are not, it is true, omitted in these pious gifts, but there are few
bequests of any value; a tenement is named, here and there, certain houses to be
sold and divided between the Augustine Friars and others; there is occasionally a
gift of wax or some such small matter. One Will in connection with this House is
noticeable. It is that of William Calley, Draper, dated 1515. He leaves to the
Honourable Company of Drapers, and to their successors, certain tenements in the
Parish of St. Margaret, Lothbury, so that the said Company shall keep an obit
within the “Frere Augustynes” of London for the benefit of his soul, for the soul
of Mawde his wife, and others named; the bequest being also charged with certain
charitable gifts. The Company and Wardens of the Craft are to attend the said
obit, and afterwards to take such refection and repast as the said Freres “ordyn and
prepaire.” And, by a codicil, William Calley wishes to be buried in the church of
the Augustines, a privilege for which substantial fees were exacted by the brethren.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CHURCH OF AUSTIN FRIARS<br />
<i>Drawn and Engraved by John Coney.</i>
</div>
</div>

<p>The references to this House are not voluminous, nor are they of very great
importance. A paper on the Church by Mr. G. H. Birch has been published in the
<cite>St. Paul’s Eccles. Soc.</cite>, vol. i. Its piers, he points out, are Perpendicular, its
windows Late Decorated, the arcades built probably in the latter part of the fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
century, and the nave wider than that of any English cathedral except, perhaps,
Chichester. The roof, before the fire of 1862, was a waggon roof with the beams
belonging to the same date as the arcades.</p>

<p>It may be noted that in the construction of their own church the Friars had to
destroy the ancient parish church of St. Olave, Broad Street, but they built on a
site adjoining the church of St. Peter-le-Poor a parish church in its place.</p>

<p>The House had four seals, one of the thirteenth century, two of the fourteenth,
and one of the fifteenth. The seal of the Prior-General of the Order contains a
figure of St. Catherine, crowned and holding a wheel.</p>

<p>In the year 1895 the demolition of certain houses on the north of the church
brought to light what appeared to be the remains of the Cloister, together with
bosses, on one of which was represented, apparently, a female figure carrying a
wheel. A paper on this discovery was communicated by Mr. Allen Walker to <cite>The
Builder</cite> (Feb. 29, Ap. 4, 1896). (See also <cite>Midd. and Herts. N. and Q.</cite>, ii. pp. 86, 136.)</p>

<p>A good many references to this House belong to the period immediately
following the Dissolution. There is the petition of St. Peter-le-Poor against the
destruction of the <i lang="fr">flèche</i>. (<cite>L. and Midd.</cite>, i., ii., 17.)</p>

<p>On the surrender of Austin Friars its revenues were valued at £57: 0: 4. The
brethren, of whom there were no more than thirteen, subscribed to the acknowledgment
of the Royal Supremacy in 1534. They were finally dispersed on the 12th
of November 1549. Although the revenues of the House were then esteemed at so
small a sum, we must remember that the Friars did not profess to hold property;
they were supposed to live on the alms of the people. George Brown, one of those
who signed the Acknowledgment, was made Archbishop of Dublin; the rest
received small pensions. The site was granted in portions to Sir Thomas
Wriothesley; to Sir W. Paulett, afterwards Marquis of Winchester; and to
Sir Richard Rich. On the site of the House and the Cloister, Winchester House
was built; the splendid monuments of the church were broken up, and the materials
sold and carried away in cartloads for the sum of £100 in all. The lovely spire was
taken down in spite of the vehement protests of the Mayor; the chancel and the
transepts were destroyed, and only the nave was left, and, in part, stands to this
day. Some thirty years ago this fragment was greatly injured by fire, but was
restored after a fashion, and at the present day, with its scanty congregation
of Dutch, by which congregation it has been used ever since the suppression, it
allows the visitor to understand of how large and spacious a church it formed a
portion.</p>

<p>In Wyngaerde’s map, and in Agas’s map (see end of <cite>London in the Time of
the Tudors</cite>), there is a rude sketch of this House as it stood before the suppression,
or immediately afterwards. In both there is a manifest indication for the position of
the cloisters. They stood on the north of the church, the transept and the north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
wall of the nave serving for two sides. The transept has long since gone—and on
the site stand modern houses. In the wall of one of these was found some years
ago a stone arch. This was noted by some antiquary, but nothing more was done.
In February 1896, however, during the demolition of this House, the arch was found
again, and before it was taken down its place was marked and it was photographed,
together with certain carved stones lying in the ground. There is very little doubt
from its position that this arch was an entrance, perhaps from the Prior’s House, to
the eastern cloister.</p>

</div>

<p>In the year 1224, being the eighth year of King Henry the Third, there arrived at
Dover a small company of nine Religious, being Brethren of the Fratres Minores,
the Franciscan Order, not yet known in this country. Five of these were priests,
the remaining four were laymen. They pushed on without delay as far as
Canterbury, where they halted and begged
permission to begin their missionary work in
that city. They were allotted a room in
which they slept at night, and in the daytime
they used it as a school. After a little it
was resolved to attempt the foundation of a
branch in London. Therefore, while the
priests remained at Canterbury, the laymen
were sent to London to look about them.
They first lodged for a fortnight with the
Preaching Friars in Holborn. They then
hired a house in Cornhill, of John Travers,
one of the Sheriffs, where they built—presumably
in the garden—rude cells of wattle
and clay, and began their preaching and
ministration among the poor of the City.
Very quickly it became noised abroad that a new and saintly Order of Religion
had arrived in the country; that its followers were absolutely unlike all other
Religious; that their austerity, the strictness of their Rule, their earnestness,
their eloquence, their poverty—for they owned nothing—absolutely nothing—not
even church furniture, and lived on alms, simply on whatever was
bestowed upon them by the charitable—were things never before known
among men; and that their lives were spent not in prayers and Litanies,
but in work among the dregs of the people; that none were too base, too low,
too degraded, too loathsome by disease for the offices of these good friars.
The impression produced by this phenomenon was only strengthened when John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Ewen, Mercer, bought a piece of ground in the parish of St. Nicholas Shambles
and gave it to the brethren for their use, on which they might build a house and
church. Then all the citizens began to vie with each other in making splendid
gifts to the church of these Franciscans—for themselves they took nothing, save,
as before, the broken victuals and crusts given them by the charitable. William
Joyner, Mayor, built the Choir; Henry Waleys, Mayor, built the Nave; Walter
Potter, Alderman, built the Chapter House; Thomas Filcham built the Vestry
House; Gregory Rokesley, Mayor, built the Dormitories and furnished them;
Bartholomew of the Castle built the Refectory; Peter de Heyland built the study;
Richard Whittington, Mayor, founded the Library. Nor was the support of the
Franciscans limited to the citizens. Queens, Princesses, and great lords helped
to endow the House and to make these poor mendicants rich. Queen Margaret,
Queen Isabel, Queen Philippa; the Earls of Gloucester, Richmond, and Pembroke;
the Countesses of Pembroke and Norfolk, all gave money, plate, lands, or buildings
to the Friars. One Queen thought the choir ought to be more splendid, and rebuilt
it; another thought the nave ought to be more splendid, and rebuilt it; no gift
could be too lavish, no buildings too costly for religious men so truly and unfeignedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
religious. In our eyes it is pathetic to observe the hope and confidence always
ready to be renewed, always doomed to disappointment, with which the people
turned from one professedly ascetic order which—alas!—had fallen from its first
profession and had now become rich, fat, and lazy, to another beginning with the
best intentions, itself destined before long to fall off from the early zeal and the
first austerities. Who could retain the pristine austerity when all these gifts came
pouring in? When the broken victuals became a steady shower of all the good
things that the earth had to give? And the despised and poverty-stricken brothers,
lean, hungry, hollow-eyed, filled with the fever of faith and zeal, had become
transformed into the sleek and comfortable Friars of whom all men spoke well?</p>

<p>Their church was 300 feet long, 89 feet wide, and 64 feet 2 inches high. It
contained an immense number of monuments, because the ground was supposed
to be the holiest in all London. Here were buried Margaret, daughter of Philip,
King of France, and second wife of Edward the First; Isabel, daughter of Philip
le Bel of France, and wife of Edward the Second—with her, the heart of the
husband whom she had betrayed; Joan of the Tower, daughter of Edward the
Second, and wife of Edward Bruce, King of Scotland; Lady Isabel Fitzwarren,
Isabel, Countess of Bedford, daughter of Edward the Third; Eleanor, Duchess of
Brittany; Beatrice, Duchess of Brittany; Eleanor, Duchess of Buckingham; Lady
de Lisle; the Countess of Devon; Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk; Eleanor,
Duchess of Northumberland; and an immense number of great and noble persons.
Had the church with all its monuments survived, there would have been no church
in the country, or, perhaps, in any other country, more crowded with names of
personal and historical interest. Of London worthies, we find the gallant John
Philpot once Mayor; Nicholas Brembre also Mayor, who finished his career with
a traitor’s death; John Gisors sometime Mayor; many of the Blunts—Lords
Mountjoy, who married into London families—the wife of Edward Blunt, Lord
Mountjoy, was the widow of one Mayor and the daughter of another; William
Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, married the daughter of Henry Keble, mercer. There were
a vast number besides, some of whom are enumerated by Stow, who tells us that
the church had ten great tombs of alabaster and marble—he means tombs with
chapels and carved work. Of less costly tombs there were some score. In the
Dissolution all the glorious marble and alabaster work was sold for fifty pounds
or thereabouts by Sir Martin Bower, Goldsmith. The revenue of the House was
no more than £32: 10s.</p>

<p>An examination of those London Wills (Sharpe’s <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite>) which
contain any mention of the Grey Friars shows that out of fifty-three nearly all are
bequests of money “for a trental of masses”; for a Dirige and a Placebo in the
church; for “masses”; for prayers; in some cases a charity is founded; in many
the testator wishes to be buried in the church; in a great many cases money is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
left to all the orders of friars in the City, which are sometimes named, but generally
not. I have elsewhere called attention to the remarkable fact that the stream of
bequests and legacies to the Religious Houses becomes narrowed early in the
fifteenth century and dries up altogether before the end.</p>

<p>The extent of the Grey Friars’ monastery can be traced by considering the
present site of Christ’s Hospital. The school, unable to extend itself on the east,
west, or north, spread out beyond the wall, which was at this point taken down
soon after the foundation of the school. The monastery, therefore, was bounded
on the north side by the wall; on the east by King Edward Street, formerly
Butcher’s Hall Lane, and by old Stinking Lane; on the west by the wall and
Newgate; and on the south by Newgate Street. It occupied, that is to say, a
corner of the city of irregular shape, being 600 feet from east to west; 300
feet at its greatest breadth from north to south; and 80 feet, or perhaps
100, at its least breadth; an area, that is, of about 45,000 square feet. The
Cloisters, in which lie buried a considerable multitude of London citizens, were
asphalted and used for the boys’ playing field; some fragments of the old building
still remain. As for the old monastery, it has entirely perished—church—cloisters—everything
in the Fire of 1666. The monuments, we know, had gone long before.</p>

<p>While I write, the place itself is doomed. The spirit of barbarous vandalism
has seized upon the school. Before long the school which, for three hundred years,
has been the object of so much pride and affection among the citizens, will exist
no longer. Another school—a new school, not the same—will be called by the
name, and will be found somewhere in the country, and the Bluecoat school, with
all its memories of Grecians, and of the young King Edward, and of the Grey
Friars, will be swept away and blotted out. It is pitiful; it is wonderful that such
things should be possible.</p>

<p>A plan of Grey Friars in the year 1617, when the old buildings were not
yet all destroyed, and the plan of the House could still be made out, is preserved
in Bartholomew’s Hospital, and has been reproduced by the <cite>London and Midd.
Archæological Society</cite>, vol. v. p. 420. It shows that the north side of Newgate
Street consisted of a row of tenements belonging to the Goldsmiths’ Company:
the Bridge house and St. Bartholomew’s; behind the tenements and south of the
wall lay the Precinct of Grey Friars. The church, with its middle and two side
aisles, its great west window, its high roof and its Clere-story, might be re-drawn
from the sketch in the plan; the Great and Little Cloisters are still standing with
the old courts and gardens, the Brewhouse and the Bakehouse, the Mill and the
great and small gates; the wall running along the north side is pierced by a gate
connecting the Precinct with Smithfield, and the wall of the Precinct running along
the east side is Stinking Lane.</p>

<p>There is not much that is important in the MS. notes referring to this House.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
In 1340 a great storm battered to the ground part of the church, especially
the west end. In 1360 we find certain persons after murdering the Porter of
Newgate Prison, taking sanctuary in the Grey Friars’ Church. This points to flight
and pursuit, since the Sanctuary of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, a much safer place, was
only a few minutes’ run down the street.</p>

<p>At the time of the Dissolution, as has already been stated, the condition and
reputation of the Friars were as bad as they could be; their buildings were falling
into ruin; they were selling their gold and silver vessels and the lead off their
roofs; the Franciscans of London had dwindled down to fifteen only when the
House surrendered. The Head of the House alone of his Order received a
pension.</p>

<p>For a time the place served as a storehouse for all kinds of things, especially
merchandise taken from the French. In the first year of Edward the Sixth all the
tombs, altars, stalls, walks of the choir, and altars in the church were pulled up and
sold—of course as so much marble and stone in the rough.</p>

<p>When the House was given to the City there are enumerated the Fratry, the
Library, the Dorter, the Chapter House, the Great Cloister, the Little Cloister,
and the chambers and buildings which had been in the recent occupancy of
certain persons named.</p>

<p>Some of the buildings which escaped the Great Fire were still standing at the
end of the eighteenth century. The south side of the Cloisters was not yet swept
away; on the north side some of the walls and windows of Whittington’s Library
were standing. The western walk of the Cloister was under the Great Hall, which,
with Whittington’s Buildings, were pulled down in 1827.</p>

<small>THE DOMINICANS</small></h3>


<p>The Dominicans, or Black Friars, came over to England with their Prior, Gilbert de
Fraxineto, in the year 1221. There were thirteen of them in company. They
were at first received by Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, who invited
the Prior to preach, and being greatly pleased with his discourse, became the patron
of the Order in England.</p>

<p>Their first quarters were in Holborn on the south side, part of the site of
Lincoln’s Inn. Here they built a House and church, and their gates opened upon
Holborn on the west side of Chancery Lane. They remained here for more than
fifty years, when, in 1276, Gregory de Rokesley, the Mayor, granted the Archbishop
of Canterbury permission to stop up certain lanes adjoining Castle Baynard and
Montfichet. This was for the purpose of enabling the Dominicans to build a new
House on the foreshore or banks of the River Fleet without the wall of the City.
The Friars, however, were permitted to take down the wall between Ludgate Hill
and the river, and to use the stones of Montfichet Castle for their new buildings.
The King ordered the City at the same time to build a new wall along the side of
Ludgate Hill, and so south along the bank of the Fleet to the Thames. Of their
first House little is known. There was once a convocation of their Order held
there attended by four hundred Friars to confer on their own affairs. It is reported
that the assemblage was entertained on one day by the King, on the next by the
Queen, and on other days by the Bishop of London and the Abbots of St. Albans,
Waltham, and Westminster.</p>

<p>If we consider the buildings of the second House we shall find ourselves
assisted to a certain extent by the disposition of the courts and lanes at the present
moment. Thus, the boundaries of the Precinct are those of the present parish of
St. Anne. It is therefore proved that the Friars began by taking down the old
wall of the City between Ludgate Hill and the river, in order to build over that
part of their Precinct which came to them on the other side of the wall.
Again, since the site of a burial-ground within a city is almost always ancient,
we may conclude that any burial-ground now within the parish was formerly
within the Precinct. And if we have the measurements of the Church, we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
lay it down accurately, provided we have a single angle or corner with which
to start.</p>

<p>Now, the burial-ground of St. Anne’s still remains untouched. Its length from
east to west is about 60 feet. The church of the Friars was 220 feet long and
66 feet broad. It probably consisted of chancel and nave, or antechapel without
transepts; the Cloister was a square of 110 feet; the Chapter House on the west
was 44 feet by 22 feet. If the chancel was 60 feet long, which is a very fair
proportion, it just fits in south of the present burial-ground, while the block of
buildings looking upon Church Court corresponds with the breadth of the church.
Laying down the church, therefore, with these data, we find the Cloister also fits in
with its square of 110 feet, now partly occupied by the Court of the Apothecaries’
Hall.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The rest of the buildings, the dormitories, the Chapter House, the Refectory,
the Great Hall, the Misericordia, were all contained in the square of the north-west
angle. To place them lower down below the church and cloisters would be to ruin
the effect of the group of buildings from the river, a thing abhorrent to the mediæval
mind. The lower space, representing an area of more than three acres, was
doubtless filled up with gardens, orchards, and offices. In appearance the House
was said to resemble a fortress, because it had the battlements and towers of the City
wall on two sides. (See Appendix IX.)</p>

<p>If for many generations the Franciscans were of all the Religious the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
loved, their rivals, the Black Friars, who were considered the most stalwart defenders
of the Faith, were the most respected for their learning. Even when the people
threatened to destroy their House, in consequence of their arrogance, they still
retained the general respect for learning. Their Precinct was a Sanctuary, so also
was that of the Grey Friars; their strong-rooms and treasure-houses were used for
the storing of the National Records, Acts, and Charters; they numbered among
their body the greatest scholars, theologians, and jurists; their hall was used for
the meeting of Parliament, and their church for the hearing of great cases. In the
year 1382, for instance, Archbishop Courtenay held in the Blackfriars’ Church his court
for the condemnation of Wyclyf’s opinions: and here was held, from day to day,
and from week to week, the great trial before Cardinals Campeggio and Wolsey
concerning the divorce of Queen Catherine. In the Hall of the Dominicans was
assembled one of the Parliaments of Henry the Sixth; here was commenced the
so-called “Black” Parliament of Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>There are many other historical notes connected with this Order in London.
Here are one or two of the more important:—</p>

<p>In 1258 the King gave orders that the Dominicans were to have at their desire
freestone for making carved statues in stone and a pedestal for the statue of the
Virgin; lead for their aqueduct, and other materials for the forwarding of their
work. Obviously, therefore, they were engaged in building at their old House.</p>

<p>In 1326, when the Queen and her son issued letters to the citizens of London
exhorting them to aid in destroying the enemies of the country, and Hugh le
Despenser in especial, it was at the House of the Friars Preachers that the Mayor
and Aldermen received the commonalty in conference. A little later occurs the
very curious story (<cite>Chron. of Mayors and Sheriffs</cite>, p. 267) of the removal of Edward
the Second to Berkeley Castle for fear that he might be carried off by the abetting
and procurement of a Brother Thomas Dunheved, a Dominican, who, with many
others of that Order, conspired with him. This Brother Thomas had been sent to
the Pope from Edward to pray for a divorce from Isabel; he now raised a body
of men in the King’s service, was unsuccessful, was taken prisoner, confined in
Pontefract Castle, and was killed while endeavouring to escape. There were
evidently two parties among the Preaching Friars.</p>

<p>Later on we hear of a quarrel between the Duke of York and the Duke of
Somerset, and of the spoiling of the goods of the latter by the people of the former
at the Friars Preachers’.</p>

<div class="caption">A COLUMN OF THE HALL OF BLACKFRIARS’ PRIORY<br />

</div>
</div>

<p>The place was also one at which Royal and distinguished persons were
entertained. The Dominicans, for instance, received Charles the Fifth of Spain on
his visit to Henry the Eighth. It was in the Hall, called the Parliament Chamber,
that Wolsey was found guilty on a Præmunire. The brethren, of course, took no
part in these functions; but the fact that they were held in their House proves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
position which they occupied. They did not, being mendicants, and without property,
entertain Royal persons at their own charges. The sentence on Wolsey was the
last event of importance connected with the Black Friars. Within a very few years
after the holding of that Court, the proud Dominicans were turned into the street.
Their whole property consisted of a few houses within the Precinct, which were
valued at an annual rental of £104: 15: 4, so that, like the Franciscans, they remained
actually mendicant to the very end. The respect in which these Friars were held,
especially by the better sort, is shown by the list of great people buried in their
church. Among the names we find those of Margaret, Queen of Scots; Hubert
de Burgh, Earl of Kent; the children of the Earl of Arundel; Queen Eleanor,
wife of Edward the First, whose heart lay here; the Earls of March and Hereford;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
the Duchess of Exeter, and many more. The House was surrendered in 1539. It
does not appear that anything was done with it in the lifetime of Henry the Eighth.
Very possibly he kept the place as convenient for holding Parliaments on occasion;
it was also, and had been, at least since the time of Edward the Second, a house
where Records and Charters were kept. Edward the Sixth granted the Hall and
the site of the Prior’s House to Sir Francis Bryan; three years afterwards he gave
the whole Precinct to Sir Thomas Cawardine.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Liberties of Sanctuary, especially that of St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
were always a great trouble and annoyance to the City. Now the
Precincts both of the Grey Friars and the Black Friars were claimed—though there
were no more Friars—by those who had succeeded in the ownership of the Precincts
as being without the jurisdiction of the City, and privileged, whether for those who
took Sanctuary in the Precinct, or for those who carried on trade to be free
of the City. This claim was stoutly resisted by the City authorities, and in 1586
the case was heard in Court before the Chief Justices.</p>

<p>There was a small church called the Church of St. Anne, which appears to have
stood beside the great church, just as St. Margaret’s stands beside the Abbey;
St. Gregory beside St. Paul’s; St. Peter’s beside the Austin Friars. The Precinct
became the Parish of St. Anne. The old church of St. Anne seems to have
perished with the Friars’ church. Perhaps it was an aisle. Then they built
another church, which was nothing more than an upper chamber. As for the
liberties and privileges of the Precinct, these were gradually forgotten and lost like
those of the Grey Friars. The church was unroofed for the sake of the lead; it was
then divided into two parts, part becoming a carpenter’s yard, and part converted
into stables. The church, according to Wyngaerde, had no transepts, so that it
would be easy to divide it. The Hall remained standing for some time longer, and
was used for a Theatre—Burbage’s Theatre,—and some of the Shakespearian plays
were acted there.</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the Precinct was “much inhabited” by noblemen
and gentlemen. Afterwards the place became the residence of feather-dressers
and glass-blowers—because it was still outside the City,—and later still of artists.
“Thence into Blackfriars, visit the painters where you may see pictures” (Ben
Jonson, <cite>The Devil is an Ass</cite>). Vandyck died here in 1641; Cornelius Jansen
lived here; Isaac Oliver died here. There is one spot in modern Blackfriars which
may still be recognised as part of the ancient house of the Dominicans. Passing
through Playhouse Yard at the back of the <cite>Times</cite> office, and turning into a narrow
lane called Church Entry, there is the small disused burial-ground of which I have
already spoken. An open yard on the other side of the court apparently formed
part of the Friars’ cemetery, just as at Westminster, where, the cloisters being
reserved for the brethren, there might be a burial-ground outside the church. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
the east of this yard is a fragment of ancient wall, and in a carpenter’s shop (No. 7
Ireland Yard) there is still (April 1900) remaining a single arch which once formed
part of the House. I know not to what building this arch belonged; the site was
afterwards a mortuary and a Watch house, but I know not which of these uses was
the earlier.</p>

<small>WHITEFRIARS</small></h3>


<p>On the north bank of the river, between Bridewell and the Temple, stood the
House of the White Friars—<i lang="la">Fratres Beatæ Mariæ de Monte Carmeli</i>,—first
founded by Sir Richard Gray in the year 1241. King Edward the First gave them
ground in Fleet Street; their House was enlarged and beautified in 1350 by Hugh
Courtenay, Earl of Devon. John Lovekyn, Mayor of London, gave them a lane
running from Fleet Street to the river, in order to extend the west end of their
church. Sir Robert Knowles, in the reign of Henry the Fourth, rebuilt the church.
The London House of White Friars was always a house of humble pretensions and
small consideration, although from time to time it received the patronage of wealthy
benefactors.</p>

<p>The buildings of the House were apparently of no great account. After the
Dissolution they became ruinous and were pulled down. A small part of the crypt,
apparently, of the church was discovered a few years ago to be still in existence.
It is beside the cellar of a house in a small court.</p>

<p>I find in an old and very scandalous story that one John le Moigne, together
with William Portehors, of the Carmelite Friars, London, and others were accused
of slaying by night a certain Friar Gilbert de Stretton of the Order, and afterwards
breaking open the treasury and stealing £300 belonging to Sir Eustace de la
Hacha. John le Moigne was found not guilty. There appear to have been two
other trials in the same case. In the first of these two one William Crepyn
took the place of John le Moigne, the other prisoners being the same. In
the second case Bartholomew Portehors, one supposes a brother of the Friar,
stood his trial with the same set of prisoners and was acquitted. Nothing is
said of Friar William and the others. We may hope that their innocence was
also fully proven.</p>

<p>Trials were occasionally heard at this House. In 1313 John de Ely, for taking
gifts from men of London and hindering the King’s right, was tried before the
King’s Council at the Carmelite Friars, convicted, and sent to Newgate.</p>

<p>The Rolls of Chancery were for some time kept in this House. In the Paston
Letters two of the family desire to be buried in the Church of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> “Fryers
Preachers”; Sir John Paston, however, in his will, desired to be buried in the
church of the White Friars.</p>

<p>The White Friars surrendered their House in 1538. It was valued with
their property at £62: 7: 3. There seems to have been no delay in pulling down
the church and buildings of this House, and very shortly after the suppression,
according to Stow, noblemen and others built upon the site. Sir John Cheke,
tutor to Edward the Sixth, lived in one of the new houses. Unfortunately the right
of Sanctuary, which belonged to the Precinct while it was a Monastic establishment,
continued to be claimed after it became secularised. In the year 1609 the right
was formally granted by a charter of James the First, not only to this Precinct but
to that of Blackfriars. This privilege, which transformed Whitefriars into the
notorious Alsatia, continued till the year 1697, when it was finally abolished. Part of
the House was allowed to remain, and become the residence of some of the Greys.
John Selden, jurist and author, lived in it 1651 to 1654, when he died.</p>

<p>The buildings were so entirely destroyed that all trace of them above ground
had vanished apparently in Stow’s time. Nor was it until the other day
known where the church of the Friars actually stood. In the autumn of 1895,
however, a discovery was made which seems to throw light on the matter. On the
west side of Whitefriars Street, low down, is a small court called Britten’s Court,
containing half a dozen houses, apparently about two hundred years old. One of
these, Number 4, was placed in the hands of Messrs. Lumley, Land Agents and
Auctioneers, 22 St. James’s Street, for sale. On examining the house, Mr. Lumley
found that it contained a small cellar under the court itself. This cellar, nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
filled up with rubbish, had been used as a storehouse for wood and coal. On
examination, it turned out to be a crypt, in dimensions a square of 12 feet 3, with
a height of 8 feet above the present level of the excavation, and a height from the
crown of the vault to the pavement of the court of about 2 feet 6 inches. The crypt
belongs to late fourteenth-century work. Eight ribs meet in a rose in the centre.
The roof is of church stone, such as was used in the construction of Westminster
Abbey. In the north-west corner is an old doorway.</p>

<small>ST. MARY OF GRACES</small></h3>


<p>This House was called that of St. Mary of Graces, or Eastminster, or New Abbey.
It was situated without the walls by East Smithfield. Newcourt gives the following
account of it:—</p>

<p>“In the Year 1348 (23 Edw. III.), the first Great Pestilence in his time
began and increased so sore, that for want of room in Church-yards to bury the Dead
of the City, and of the Suburbs, one John Corey, Clerk, procured of Nicholas, Prior
of the Holy Trinity within Ealdgate, one Toft of ground near East Smithfield for
the burial of them that died, with condition, that it might be call’d, The Church
yard of the Holy Trinity; which Ground he caused by the aid of divers Devout
Citizens to be inclos’d with a Wall of Stone, and the same was dedicated by Ralph
Stratford, Bishop of London, where innumerable Bodies of the Dead were afterwards
buried, and a Chapel built in the same Place to the Honour of God. To
which King Edward setting his Regard (having been in a Tempest on the Sea,
and in peril of drowning made a Vow to build a Monastery to the Honour of God,
and the Lady of Grace, if God would grant him Grace to come safe to Land) builded
a Monastery, causing it to be call’d East-minster, placing an Abbot, and Monks of
the Cistertian or White Order there.</p>

<p>In Order whereunto the said King Edward, by his Letters Patents bearing
date at Westminster, March 29, in the 24th of his reign (1349) for the first Founding
and Endowment of this Abbey, gave to the Abbot and Monks thereof, all those
Messuages, with the Appurtenances at Tower Hill, which he had of Joh. Cory aforesaid,
in pure and perpetual Alms. Ordering this House to be call’d, Liberam
Capellam Regiam Beatæ Mariæ de Gratiis. And afterwards by other Letters
Patents, dated Octob. 5, in the 50th of his Reign, he gave and granted to John,
Duke of Lancaster, Simon, Archbishop of Canterbury, John, Bishop of Lincoln,
and others, certain Mannours and Lands, which he purchased in Kent, and elsewhere,
for the farther Endowment of this Abbey, which they after his Death granted
and confirm’d to the said Abbot and Monks for a certain term of Years.</p>

<p>But these lands being for certain Causes seiz’d into the hands of King Richard
II. as forfeited, he, by his Letters Patents, dated Aug. 3, in the 12th of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Reign by advice of his Counsel, gave and granted the Rents, Issues and Profits
of those Mannours and Lands, which were the Mannours of Leybourne, Gravesend,
Leach, Wattingbury, Gore, Parrock and Bykenore, with their Appurtenances,
together with the Advowsons of the Church of Bykenore, and of the Churches of the
other places above-named, with all other their Appurtenances in the County of Kent.
As also the Reversion of the Mannour of Gomshalf with its Appurtenances, in the
County of Surry, after the Death of Thomas de Stanes, to pray for the Good Estate
of the said King whilst alive, and for his Soul when dead, and for the Soul of his
Grandfather King Edw. III. and for the Souls of all his Progenitors, his Heirs, and
Successors, and all the Faithful deceas’d, according to the Intention and Will of his
said Grandfather. And farther, gave Licence to the Said John, Duke of Lancaster,
and John, Bishop of London, the surviving Feoffees of Edw. III. to release and
quit-claim the said Mannours and Lands to the said Abbot and Monks, and their
Successors, as appears by his Letters Patents, dated at Notingham, July 3.</p>

<p>William de S. Cruce, late Abbot of Geranden of the Cistertian Order, was at
the King’s instance made the first Abbot of this House, to whom the King gave
£20 per ann. for the Maintenance of himself and his Monks, March 24, 1349.</p>

<p>Will. de Warden was made Abbot of this House, Aug. 27, 1360.</p>

<p>This Abby was surrender’d Anno. 1539 (30 Hen. VIII.), and was valued at
£546: 0: 10 per Ann., Dugdale; £602: 11: 10, Speed.</p>

<p>Since which time the said Monastery being by King Hen. VIII. in the 34. of
his Reign granted to Sir Arthur Darcy, Knight, was clean pull’d down. And of
late time in place thereof is built a large Store-house for Victual, and convenient
Ovens are built there for baking of Bisquets to serve Her Majesties Ships: and it
is the Victualling Office for the Royal Navy to this day; the Grounds adjoining
and belonging formerly to the said Abbey, are occupied by small Tenements built
thereon.” (Newcourt, i. pp. 465-466.)</p>

<p>To this account it may be added that the House does not seem to have
attracted many other benefactors, while in the <cite>Calendar of Wills</cite> there are only six
bequests to the Abbey. One testator devises money for the buildings; one gives
a small sum of money; three leave houses; one founds a chantry. It may be
presumed that the proportion of bequests to this House compared with those made
to others was the same with the wills not presented in these two volumes. Yet its
surrender value, as we have seen, was considerable. In the first volume of the
<cite>Transactions of the Lond. and Midd. Archæological Association</cite> is published an
early representation of the Abbey, taken probably just before the Dissolution.</p>

<small>THE SMALLER FOUNDATIONS</small></h3>


<p>Among the Houses mentioned by Arnold FitzThedmar are two or three not
considered in the above enumeration. There are the Houses of St. Anne by
the Tower Hill, St. James in the Temple, St. James in the Wall, St. Stephen’s
at Westminster, St. Thomas’ Chapel of the Bridge, St. James in the Field, St.
Mary Magdalen Guildhall, St. Mary Rouncevall, and St. Ursula in the Poultry.
There are one or two others which shall here be briefly mentioned.</p>

<p>Concerning many of these Houses, so little is known that the list becomes
merely a catalogue. The position of these smaller Houses in the City in some
respects corresponded to that of the humbler Dissenting Chapels of the present
day. That is to say, although at the time there could be no thought of separation
or of schism, the poor folk found themselves more at home in the smaller Houses.
With them they had their Craft Fraternities; their priests were not the great
Ecclesiastical Lords of the stately Abbeys and priories, but of humbler guise, men
accessible to themselves.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Order of Penitence or Fratres de Saccâ</span></h4>

<p>The Order of Penitence grew out of the teaching of Francis of Assisi very
early in his career. It was brought under rule by the Bull “Significatum est,”
dated December 16, 1221, but it is said to have existed before this date.</p>

<p>Among other things, the order actually forbade the carrying of arms. They
anticipated the Quakers, they anticipated the Peace Society, they were many
centuries in advance of mankind. Like the Quakers, they did not understand that
the very existence of a people under the conditions of the time—and of our time as
well—rests upon force and strength of arms.</p>

<p>The great innovation designed by the Third Order was concord; this fraternity
was a union of peace, and it attempted to bring before astonished Europe a new
truce of God.</p>

<p>The second essential obligation of the Brothers of Penitence appears to have
been that of reducing their wants as far as possible, and while preserving their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
fortunes, to distribute to the poor, at proper intervals, such portions of the
revenue as remained after contenting themselves with the strict necessaries of life.</p>

<p>To carry on with contentment and uprightness the duties of their calling;
to seek a holy inspiration for the slightest actions of life; to find in the infinitely
little and ephemeral events of existence, the things apparently the most commonplace,
the handiwork of the Almighty; to keep pure from debasing deeds, words,
thoughts, ambitions, and interests, to use things as if not possessing them, like the
servants in the parable who knew that they would have to give an account of the
talents confided to them; to close their hearts to hatred; to open them wide to
pity; to give their aid to the old, the poor, the infirm, the diseased, the outcast and
the abandoned: such were the other essential duties of this most excellent Order of
Penitence.</p>

<p>The letter to all Christians in which these thoughts break forth is a living
souvenir of St. Francis’s teachings to the Tertiaries. To represent these latter to
ourselves in a perfectly concrete form, we may resort to the legend of St. Lucchesio,
whom tradition makes the first Brother of Penitence.</p>

<p>And the history of the first Brother of Penitence may be thus condensed into
a short narrative:—</p>

<p>A native of a little city of Tuscany, he quitted it to avoid its political enmities,
and established himself at Poggibonsi, not far from Sienna, where he continued to
trade in grain. Already rich, it was not difficult for him to buy up all the wheat,
and, selling it in a time of scarcity, realise enormous profits. But he was disturbed
in conscience: he was convinced—it is exactly like the report of a Salvation Army
meeting—by the preaching of Francis of Assisi: he was enabled to see himself from
the outside—which is indeed the beginning of all repentance and conviction: he
resolved to bestow the whole of his superfluous wealth upon the poor, and to keep
nothing at all but his house with a small garden and one ass. From that time he
was to be seen devoting himself to the cultivation of his ground and the conversion
of his house into a sort of free hostelry, which was filled with the poor and the sick.
He not only welcomed them, but he sought them out, even to the malaria-infested
Maremma, often returning with a sick man astride on his back and preceded by
his ass bearing a similar burden. The resources of the garden were necessarily
limited: when there was no other way, Lucchesio took a wallet and went from
door to door asking alms, but most of the time this was needless, for his poor
guests, seeing him so diligent and so good, were better satisfied with a few poor
vegetables from the garden, shared with him, than with the most copious repast. In
the presence of their benefactor, so joyful in his destitution, they forgot, it is said,
their own poverty—one reads with doubt this statement,—and the habitual murmurs
of the poor, half-starved and diseased creatures were transformed into outbursts of
admiration and gratitude. Conversion had not killed in him all family ties: Donna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Bona his wife, became his fellow-labourer, and when in 1260 he saw her gradually
fading away, his grief was too deep to be endured. “You know, dear companion,” he
said to her when she had received the last sacraments, “how much we have loved
one another while we could serve God together: why should we not remain united
until we depart to the ineffable joy? Wait for me. I also will receive the sacraments,
and go to heaven with you.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>So he spoke, and called back the priest to administer them to him. Then after
holding the hands of his dying consort, comforting her with gentle words, when he
saw that her soul was gone, he made over her the sign of the cross, stretched himself
beside her, and calling with love upon Jesus, Mary, and St. Francis, he fell asleep
for eternity.</p>

<p>The Order, therefore, known as Penitentiarii or Fratres de Saccâ Order,
consisted of both men and women: the latter were <i lang="la">Sorores de Pœnitentia</i>. They
might be married, in which case conjugal abstinence was enjoined on certain days;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
but they could not marry after admission; they might individually or collectively
hold property. They came over in the year 1257, and they remained until 1307,
when their Order was dissolved. They had for their House the old Jewish
Synagogue of Old Jewry, and apparently were always quite a small fraternity.
Beside their London House there were seven Houses of the Order in England, viz.
at Lynn, whose Prior was the head of the Order; at Canterbury, Cambridge,
Norwich, Worcester, Lincoln, and Leicester.</p>

<p>Their House, on the suppression in 1307, was handed over to Robert FitzWalter:
it was the same house which afterward belonged to Robert Large, to
whom Caxton was apprenticed; it stood at the north-east corner of the Old Jewry.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">St. James on the Wall</span></h4>

<p>If one stands in the south-west part of St. Giles’ churchyard, Cripplegate, one
can observe the bastion of the old stone wall which still exists there. Within this
bastion, in the corner of the wall at the end of Monkwell Street, was formerly a
small religious House, a cell of Garendon Abbey called St. James’s in the Wall; it
was originally a Hermitage, and it was placed in the corner no doubt for the same
reason that the Greyfriars’ was placed in the next corner going westward, as in a
place unoccupied and out of the way of business.</p>

<p>The founder of the Hermitage is said to have been Henry the Third.
Wilkinson (<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>) thinks that it was founded as a Chantry Chapel
endowed for a single priest; but the Hermit appears at a very early period. There
is a deed quoted by Wilkinson, dated 1253, which mentions the Chapel. In 1275 it
is found that the guardian of the place was the Mayor of London. He was
appointed by the King for a curious reason—viz. to prevent the spoliation of the
place and the robbery of the chalices, vestments, etc., on the decease of the Hermit.
The custody of the Hermitage, a few years later, was transferred to the Constable
of the Tower, Anthony Beck, afterwards Bishop of Durham. In 1299 the care of the
cell was given to the Abbey of Garendon in Leicestershire, I know not why.
Newcourt relates an anecdote of the Hermit of 1311, which illustrates the jealousy
always felt by parish priests of Hermits and others who intruded into their office:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>
<p>“I find, that in the year 1311 (Ralph de Baldock, being then Bp. of
London), and Thomas de Wyreford, an Hermit of this Cell (a presumptuous,
troublesome Man, it seems) took upon him to hear Confessions of People of the
neighbouring Parishes, to enjoyn Penances, to grant Indulgences for 500 Days to
such as frequented his Hermitage, and the like, having no lawful Authority so to
do. For which Offences he was judicially proceeded against by the Bishop, and
pronounc’d Guilty, and to be a Transgressor of the Canons; whereupon he was
admonish’d to make Satisfaction for the same, within 15 days, and inhibited to do
the like, as also were the People warn’d not to follow, or to be seduc’d by him,
under Pain of Excommunication.” (Newcourt, vol. i.)</p>

<p>In 1315 the custody of the place was committed to one Walter Kemesey: in
1343 William de Lyons was the Hermit. In 1347 the Abbey of Garendon sent
two chaplains here to pray for the soul of the Earl of Pembroke, who was killed in
a tournament on the day of his third marriage, and of his widow, who retired from
the world, and devoted herself to acts of piety and charity.</p>

<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1543 the site of the Hermitage was granted by Henry the Eighth to
William Lambe, citizen and clothworker, one of the gentlemen of the King’s-house
here.</p>

<p>The Fire seems to have damaged, but not destroyed, this Chapel. It was
rebuilt with considerable alterations, and continued to be used as a church until its
demolition in 1825, when a crypt of great interest was found below. It is described
in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> of May 1825 by Mr. A. J. Kempe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>
<p>“He there states that the recent demolition of the upper part of Lambe’s
Chapel for the purpose of rebuilding it gave access to the curious vault occupying
the space beneath. After descending ten or twelve narrow steps, a low vaulted
chamber was entered, 26 feet long from east to west, and 20 feet broad; having
in it originally nine short round columns, six of which were remaining, supporting
the groined roof of the apartment. The capitals of these columns were Saxon,
ornamented with leaves and volutes at the angles, and the capitals of the four
corner pillars were placed diagonally to the square of the building. Some
of the intersecting stone ribs springing from the columns were plain, and others
were adorned with zigzag, twisted, and other ancient mouldings; specimens of
which, with one of the pillars, and a plan of the directions of the arches, are
given on the right hand of the lower part of the present Engraving of old Lambe’s
Chapel. On the other side of the corresponding part of the same Plate is a Section
of the ornamented mouldings from one of the arches; and leaning against the wall,
in the Interior View at the top of the Plate, is represented a Ground-plan of the
Crypt, with the Outside of the Chapel. The material of which this Crypt was
constructed was freestone, of a reddish colour, the surface being very considerably
decomposed; and several modern brick walls intersected the building.” (<cite>Londina
Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Rolls House</span></h4>

<p>The very curious and interesting history of the “Rolls House” was told for
the first time, as regards its original objects, by Mr. W. P. W. Phillimore, Editor of
the <cite>London and Middlesex Note-Book</cite>, 1896. I refer the reader to that paper for
fuller details. In this place the leading facts only are taken.</p>

<p>Newcourt, after relating the origin of the House, says that the number of
converts decayed when the Jews were banished in 1290; therefore the House in
1377 was given to William Burstall, Keeper of the Rolls: that, nevertheless,
“such of the Jews as have in this Realm been converted to Christianity have been
relieved there.” It will be seen that this bald statement conveys a very erroneous
idea of the place and its history.</p>

<p>In 1232 Henry the Third made an annual grant of 700 marks for the
maintenance of those Jews who had been converted to Christianity, for finding them
a home and for building them a church. This sum was to be paid out of the
Exchequer until the House should possess property of its own equivalent. At the
same time the King founded a similar House at Oxford. The number of converts
became comparatively large: in 1256 the King’s almoner provided cloth for 150
robes for the converts; in 1257, 171 tunics for Easter and 164 for Pentecost; in
1265 the House was enlarged; in 1267 a third chaplain was added; in 1275 the
chapel was enlarged; in 1280 King Edward sanctioned certain rules for the
government of the House, especially ordering that the inmates should work at their
own handicraft, and if they were able to earn their own living, they should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
allowed to draw the allowance made to all. He also granted to the converts half
the value of all their possessions, the whole of which belonged by right to himself;
with the chevage or head tax of all the Jews in England. This chevage for
1281 amounted to £14: 14: 9, which, at 3d. a head, means only 1179 Jews in all
England—a figure which by no means agrees with the number of those who were
banished in 1290.</p>

<p>The revenues of the House for this year were a little over £50, in addition to
which they had the annual grant from the Exchequer of £53: 6: 8.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, vol. i.
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1290 the number of converts had gone down to 80. The original occupants
of the House must by this time have died and their children have become merged in
the general population. The absence of any traditional caste or class, such as that
of the <i lang="fr">Cagots</i> in the South of France, is a proof that this absorption into the
general population was complete.</p>

<p>In that year the converts petitioned the King for a Keeper who would look
after their interests. It is noted that during the next hundred years many of the
Keepers of the Domus Conversorum were also Keepers of the Rolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>However, the King answered the petition by fixing the allowance for the
House at £202: 0: 4, out of which the Fabric was to be kept up, the Master,
Chaplains, and Clerk were to be paid, and the converts were to receive weekly
allowances. On the death of a convert the amount of the grant was to be
decreased. It was evidently supposed that the converts would die off. This,
however, did not take place. On the other hand, though the numbers rapidly
decreased, the House was never without new converts. Mr. Phillimore does not
say where these converts came from: if there were no Jews left in England there
could be no converts made in this country.</p>

<p>In 1308 the converts complained that their allowances were not paid. The
King ordered an inquiry. It was found that out of all the inmates in 1290, 34
were dead, twelve had left the House, and 56 were still living there. The King
thereupon granted a reduced payment of £123: 10: 6.</p>

<p>In 1330-1 there were 8 men and 13 women converts.</p>

<p>In 1334 there were 7 men and 13 women.</p>

<p>In 1337-8 there were 13 men and as many women.</p>

<p>In 1350 there were 2 men and 2 women.</p>

<p>In 1351 Henry de Ingleby had only 1 convert under his care.</p>

<p>In 1371 William de Burstall, who was Keeper of the Rolls, was made Keeper
of the Domus Conversorum: there were then two converts. In 1377, on learning
that William de Burstall had repaired the dilapidated buildings, Edward the Third
provided that the two offices should be held together.</p>

<p>In 1386 payments were asked for the Keeper, one chaplain, one clerk, and
three converts.</p>

<p>It is very curious to find that the supply of converts continued; only once did
they wholly cease; there was sometimes only one; then three, four, eight, five,
two, and so on. Where, I repeat, did they come from? One woman was named
Elizabeth Portugall—evidently a Portuguese Jewess; another was called Elizabeth
Baptista; another was “Kateryn Wheteley,” sometime called Aysa Rudeywa;
another, Mary Coke, alias “Omell Fayll Isya.”</p>

<p>Thomas Cromwell was made Keeper in 1534. In his term of office he held
a Court of Law at the House: yet it was not without converts. In 1550, when
John Beaumont became keeper, he had but one convert, the above-named Mary
Coke.</p>

<p>When Mary Coke died in 1551 (?), there followed a period of 26 years when
there were no converts at all. In 1578 Yehoude Mende appears followed by
Fortuna Massa, Philip Ferdinando and Elizabeth Ferdinando. In 1606-7 there
were four converts. And then the allowances cease.</p>

<p>One Paul Jacob petitioned King James to grant him assistance, but he was not
received into the Domus. That part of its history was closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>In 1708 we hear that the buildings were much dilapidated: in 1717 the Rolls
House was built upon the site of the Domus. And the Chapel was used as
a muniment room for depositing the rolls of Chancery, until their removal to the
Public Record Office.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen and All Saints Guildhall</span></h4>

<p>The foundation of a college dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen is said by Stow
to have taken place in 1299. It appears to have been so much enriched seventy
years later by Adam Francis and Henry de Frowick as to have become a new
Foundation. A third benefactor, Peter Fantore, died before his intentions were
carried out. It was endowed for five chaplains who were to pray for the souls of
the Founders, their wives, and their children, King Edward the Third, and all
departed Kings, Mayors, Wardens, Sheriffs, and Chamberlains of the City. In the
year 1430, the buildings, having become ruinous, were pulled down and others
erected on the south side of them. In 1450 the parish clerks obtained leave to have
a Guild dedicated to St. Nicholas in the Chapel, with two chaplains and seven
almspeople.</p>

<p>At the Dissolution the College had a Warden, seven chaplains, three clerks,
and four choristers. The Chapel was given to the Mayor and Aldermen, for whom
services were held in it on certain occasions.</p>

<p>In the year 1785 the Chapel was made into a Court of Requests, and so
remained until the year 1820, when it was taken down.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Chapel and College of Leadenhall</span></h4>

<p>This very ancient market was the property of the City as early as the first
quarter of the fourteenth century. The College was founded by Simon Eyre,
draper and Mayor, in 1445, when he also built a granary.</p>

<p>It was to consist of a Warden, five secular priests, six clerks, and two choristers
to sing mass daily: there were also to be three schoolmasters with an usher; one
master, to wit, with an usher, for grammar; one for writing; and one for singing;
the masters were to have a yearly stipend of £10; every other priest £8; every
clerk £5: 6: 8; and every chorister £3: 6: 8. Stow says that the conditions of the
will were not carried out as regards the services in the Chapel and the free school.</p>

<p>But, in 1466, a Fraternity of the Holy Trinity was founded in connection with
the Chapel by three priests. It consisted of 60 priests with other brothers and
sisters. They performed divine service every market day in the afternoon, and
once a year they had a solemn service with a procession of all the Fraternity.
The property of this Fraternity amounted to £7: 10s. yearly.</p>

<p>The chapel escaped the Great Fire. It was pulled down in 1812. Wilkinson
thus describes it:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<p>“This Chapel projected eastward from the exterior of the eastern cloisters of
Leadenhall, from which it was entered by a large arched doorway, having the
arms of the founder over the centre; and on each side of the interior arch was
a perforated Gothic screen, of exquisite workmanship. The building was oblong,
and was divided on the exterior sides into four parts, by buttresses reaching nearly
to the roof, and separating as many large windows of the depressed pointed arch
form, each parted into three lights, by stone mullions with cinquefoil arches; the
window at the eastern end being considerably larger than the other, and containing
five lights. On the outside the Chapel was almost completely enclosed by a case
of wooden sheds, which reached nearly to the bases of the windows. It was
covered with rafters and tiling of the coarsest modern workmanship, instead of the
ancient roof, which had been pointed, and was supported within by carved brackets
of chestnut wood, resting on corbels let into the walls against the buttresses: but
of those brackets, only the scrolls and one fragment remained when the building was
destroyed. Within the Chapel, at the south-west corner, was a small oaken door
curiously studded and panelled, opening into a square apartment, which had
probably been the sacristy; against the walls of which Mr. John Thomas Smith
discovered some slight remains of painted figures. One of these exhibited the
cheek, ear, and side of a head, with long yellow hair, flowing over blue and red
drapery; the whole very much resembling the paintings discovered in St. Stephen’s
Chapel, Westminster, executed in the reign of Edward III. Those at Leadenhall,
however, were neither embossed nor gilded; but were outlined and shaded with
red ochre.” (Wilkinson, vol. ii.)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Nunnery of Kilburn</span></h4>

<p>This small House, a cell to the Abbey of Westminster, is, in history, chiefly
an account of the jealousies of the Bishop of London and the Abbot of Westminster
as to the Episcopal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Its history is curious. One Godwyn, a recluse, built a hermitage at Kilburn
on some land belonging to himself. He conveyed the land to the Abbey of
Westminster, by whom a small convent was built on the spot for three ladies, maids
of honour to Matilda, Queen of Henry the First. Godwyn became Warden for
life, and the Abbey made provision for the maintenance of the nuns.</p>

<p>On the foundation of the nunnery, Gilbert, the Bishop of London, exempted it
from his own jurisdiction. This exemption was questioned by Roger le Noir,
Bishop in 1229. In 1231 a composition was entered into between the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul’s on the one side and the Abbot of Westminster on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>, published 1825 by R. Wilkinson, No. 125 Fenchurch Street.
</div>
</div>

<p>“By virtue of this agreement the bishop for the time being was to have access
to the cell of Kilburn, to be received with procession, to preach, hear confessions,
and enjoin penances; but without being entitled to any claim for procurations. It
was also conceded that the secular priest, or warden, who was set over the house
by the abbat, should, upon his appointment, be presented to the Bishop and pay
canonical obedience to him, but to be removable by the abbat alone. That the
prioress of the house, though appointed by the abbat and his successors, should be
under obedience to the bishop, saving in all things the canonical reverence and
subjection which she owed of old to the abbat. That, however, the entire ordering
or regulation of the house, concerning matters and persons within its precinct, with
the correction of excesses and reformation of its abuses, and the institution or
destitution of the prioress and nuns, should belong to the abbat and his successors
for ever; provided, that in case any matters requiring persons abiding there, should
be neglected by him for the space of a month after warning having been given to
him (or in his absence to the Prior) by the bishop, then, upon clear evidence of
such neglect of reformation, it should be lawful for the bishop himself to proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
toward correcting and reforming them in such manner as ‘prout secundum Deum
viderit expedire.’ It was further ordained that no monk but the abbat (or in
vacancy, absence, or illness, the prior) should go near the nuns to hear their
confessions and enjoin penance. That the bishop should, when requested by the
abbat, perform the office of blessing or consecrating the nuns, but that no other
bishop should be in future introduced or admitted at Kilburn to perform any
episcopal ceremony. Finally, that neither the bishop nor his chapter should, by
reason of this composition, challenge any jurisdiction or subjection over the abbat
and monks of Westminster, nor in anything derogate from the rights of the
aforesaid nuns, or their cell.” (<cite>London and Middlesex Notes</cite>, pp. 422-423.)</p>

<p>The House received a good many benefactions, but always remained a small
Foundation. The revenues, when it was dissolved, amounted to sums variously
stated between £74: 7: 11 and £121: 14s. The inventory of all the goods belonging
to the nunnery of Kilburn, the 11th day of May, 28th of Henry the Eighth, seems to
show that the House was well and completely furnished. It contained a Hall;
five chambers for the ladies of the House: Kitchen, Buttery, Pantry, Larder,
Brew-house, Bake-house, Cellar; three chambers for the Chaplain and the
Husbandmen; the Confession chamber; and the church.</p>

<p>No remains are now to be seen of this House. The last Prioress was Anne
Browne.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Nunnery of Stratford-le-Bow</span></h4>

<p>This Priory was in the Parish of Bromley, but so near to the hamlet of
Stratford-le-Bow that it was commonly called after it. The House has been sometimes
confused with a Convent of White Monks in the Parish of West Ham,
called the Abbey of Stratford Langthorne.</p>

<p>The nunnery, dedicated to St. Leonard, is said to have been founded by
William, Bishop of London, in the reign of William the Conqueror. It was always
a small house. We read of certain donations and benefactions—lands at Haseling
field; the Church of Northim, afterwards called Norton Mandeville; gifts by Henry
the Second; the Manor of Bromley; lands held by Idonea Cricket in the reign of
Edward the First, by the service of holding the King’s napkin at the Coronation.</p>

<p>Here was buried Elizabeth, sister of Queen Philippa, and daughter of William,
Earl of Hainault.</p>

<p>At the Dissolution there were a Prioress and nine nuns. The revenues of
the House were estimated, according to Dugdale, at £108: 1: 11-1/2, and according
to Speed at £121: 16s. At this time the maintenance of a chantry priest being £5
or £6 a year, the ten nuns would require about £50 for their maintenance, leaving
£70 for the House and the service. Sibilla Kirke, the last prioress, received a
pension of £15 a year. She was still living in 1553.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>The site of the Priory, the advowson of the Church, and the Manor of
Bromley, were given to Sir Ralph Saddler. The Chapel is now the Parish Church
of Bow.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">St. Augustine’s Papey</span></h4>

<p>The history of this interesting house, previously almost unknown, was rescued
by the late Rev. Thomas Hugo, who read a paper on the subject before the <cite>London
and Middlesex Archæological Society</cite> (vol. v.).</p>

<p>It was founded in 1442 by four priests of London, viz. Thomas Symmeson,
Rector of All Hallows in the Wall; William Cleve, Priest of the Charity of St.
John the Baptist in the Church of St. Mary Aldermary; William Barneby, a
Chantry Priest in St. Paul’s Cathedral; and John Stafford, Priest in London. The
Foundation was a Hospital or College for aged and impotent Priests. The
Churches of the time were filled with Chantry Priests, each of whom had to live
upon the very small endowment of a Chantry—generally £6 or £7 a year, sometimes
less—in return for a Mass said every day for the soul of the Founder. When
age fell upon these men, and they could no longer perform the one simple duty of
their life, what could they do? How could they live? We cannot believe that
an old and impotent Priest was ever suffered to starve. At the same time, until the
charity of the Papey was founded, the lot of many must have been precarious and
dependent and most miserable.</p>

<p>The Papey was situated within the wall just at the north end of the street now
called “St. Mary Axe.” In the <cite>Collections of a London Citizen</cite> (Camden Society)
it is written “Pappy Chyrche in the walle be twyne Aldgate and Bevysse Markes.
And hit ys a grete Fraternyte of prestys and other segular men. And there were
founde of almys certayne prestys both blynde and lame that be empotent: and they
have day masse and xiiij a weke, barber, and launder, and one to dresse and
provyde for hyr mete and drynke.” They also had allowance of bread and coal,
with one aged man and his wife to keep the house clean.</p>

<p>The Church and parish of St. Augustine had recently been incorporated with
that of All Hallows in the Wall. It was therefore a disused church which was first
placed at the service of these poor priests. The Rector of All Hallows, in addition,
gave over to their use a certain messuage with a garden which had been given to
All Hallows by a late citizen. The community, so formed, was to be in honour of
St. Charity and St. John the Evangelist. This name, however, was never given
to the house by the people, who called it still St. Augustine, qualified by the words
De Papey—<i>i.e.</i> of the <i>papes</i> or fathers who lived there. The Foundation was
poor; but it possessed a house at Baynard’s Castle, six cottages and two messuages
in Pavyn Alley; there was also the messuage in Bevis Marks given them by the
Rector of All Hallows. This is all the property that can be proved to belong to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
them. Those of the members who could walk and sing sometimes attended the
funerals of great persons, and in this way added something to the slender revenues
of the House. At the time of the foundation there were twenty-four brethren and
fifteen sisters—it does not appear how the sisters were elected or for what cause.</p>

<p>The history of the House is not marked, so far as I know, by a single event.
It lasted for 106 years, being suppressed by the Act of 2 Ed. VI. for the
suppression of all chantries, hospitals, and similar foundations. The value of the
land and property of the Foundation was returned at £23: 11: 8. William Nevill
purchased the House for £102. There were then six old priests but no sisters.
These, one records with satisfaction, were all provided with small pensions: the
Master receiving sixty-six shillings and eightpence a year, a little over twopence-farthing
a day, and the brethren forty shillings, a little under 1-1/3d. a day. The
church was pulled down, and an Apothecary set up his shop on the site, the Churchyard
was converted into a garden, and the Priests’ House became a private
residence. Thus was thrown down and destroyed a Foundation which might have
continued doing good work unto the present day. There is not, in fact, among all
the numerous charities, foundations, and endowments belonging to the Church, a
single House at the present day which at all corresponds with this ancient
Foundation of St. Augustine Papey.</p>

<p>The late foundation of the House, at a time when bequests to the religious
House had begun to fall off before they ceased altogether, sufficiently accounts for
its poverty. One or two bequests only, and these apparently of small account, are
on record. (See Appendix X.).</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Whittington College</span></h4>

<p>The College of St. Spirit and St. Mary, founded by Whittington, whose
intention was carried out by his executors, was for a Master, four Fellows, Clerks,
Choristers, etc., together with an Almshouse. Fortunately the Almshouse was
separated by the executors from the College, so that it was spared when the
College was suppressed. The following is a portion of the original ordinances of
the Charity drawn up by the executors:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“The fervent Desire and best Intention of a prudent, wyse and devout man that be to cast before and
make seure the State and thende of the short liffe with Dedys of Mercy and Pite: and namely to provyde
for such pouer Persons which grevous Penuere and cruel Fortune have oppressed, and be not of power to
gete their lyving either by Craft or by any other bodily Labour: whereby that at the day of the last
Jugement, he may take his part with hem that shal be saved. This considering the foresaid worthy and
notable Merchaunt Richard Whittington, the which while he leved had ryght liberal and large hands to
the Needy and Poure People, charged streitly, in his Death-bed, us his foresaid Executors, to ordeyne a
House of Almes after his Deth, for perpetual sustentacion of such poure people as is tofore rehersed: and
therupon fully he declared his Wyll unto us. And we wylling after our power to fullfil thentent of his
commendable Wille and holesome Dessre in this part, as we be bound.</p>

<p>First, Yfounded by us, with sufficient Authorite, in the Church of Seint Mighells, in the Royolle
of London: where the foresaid Richard and Dame Alice his Wife be biried, a commendable College of
certain Prestes and Clerkis; to do there every day divine Service for the aforesaid Richard and Alice.</p>

<p>We have founded also, after the Wille abovesaid, a House of Almes for XIII pouere folk
successively for evermore; to dwell and to be susteined in the same House. Which house is situated
and edified upon a certain Soyl that we bought therefore, late in the Parish of Seinte Mighel abovesaid:
that is to say, Bytweene the foresaid Church and the Wall that closeth in the voyd place, behind the
heigh Auter of the same Church in the Southside, and our great Tenement, that was late the House of
the aforesaid Richard Whyttington in the Northside. And it stretcheth fro the dwelling place of the
Master and the Prestis of the College abovesaid. The which also we did late to be now added in the
Eastside unto a great voyd place of our Land. The which by the help of God we purpose to do be
hallowed Lawfully for a Churchyard to the same Church within short time in the Westside.” (Stow, i.
bk. iii. pp. 3-4.)</p></blockquote>

<p>And the ordinances for the poor folk are as follows:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“To be twelve pouer Folks alonely of Men or Women togiddre; after the sad Discretition and good
Conscience of the Overseers underwrit, and Conservators of the same House, to be provided and
admitted.</p>

<p>The which every day, when due and convenient time is, shal pray for evermore, for al the now
being alive, and also for the bypast, to God; Whose names of great Specialty been expressed in these
Statutes underwrit.</p>

<p>To be one <em>Principal</em>, which shal pass al other in power and Reverence, and be called TUTOR.
The Office and Charge of him shal be the goods of the Almes-house, which shal come to his hands, well
and truly to minister. The Goods dissevered to gather again togidre; to the Use of the Almes-house:
And at the Husbandry of the same house, in as much as he may goodly oversee, dispose and ordain;
inforcing himself to edifie and nourish Charity and Peace among his Felawes.</p>

<p>The Poor folks unto the said <em>Tutor</em> evermore shal obey.</p>

<p>The thirteen poor folke to be hable in Conversation, and honest in Living.</p>

<p>The same House to be called for ever <em>God’s House</em>, or Almes house, or the Hospital of <em>Richard
Whyttington</em>.</p>

<p>The L. Maior to be overseer of the said Almeshouse: and the Keepers of the Commonalty of the
Craft of Mercers to be called for evermore <em>Conservators</em> of the foresaid House.</p>

<p>The Tutor to have a Place by himself, that is to say, a Cell or little House, with a Chimney and a
Prevy, and other Necessaries. In the which he shall Lyegge and rest. And that he may aloon and by

<p>Every Tutour and poor folk every day first whan they rise fro their Bedds, kneeling upon their

foresaid Richard Whyttington and Alice, to God, and our Blessed Lady Maidyn MARY. And other
times of the day, whan he may be best and most commody have leisure thereto, for the Staat of al the
Souls abovesaid, Say three or two Sauters of our Lady at the least: that is to say, threies seaven Ave
Marias, with XV pater nosters, and three Credes. But if he be letted with febleness, or any other
reasonable cawse, One in the day at the least, in case it may be: that is to say, after the Messe, or when
Complyn is don, they come togidder within the College about the Tomb of the aforesaid Rich.
Whyttington and Alice, and they that can sey, shal sey for the Soules of the seid Richard and Alice, and
for the Soules of al Christen people, this Psalm de Profundis with the Versicles and Oriosons that longeth

<p>That they be bound to dwell and abide continewally in the seid Almes house, and bounds thereof:
And that every day, booth at meet and sopier, they eet and be fed within the said Almes house. And
while they be at meet, or soupier, they absteyn thanne from veyn and ydel words. And if they wol any
thyng talk, that it be honest and profitable.</p>

<p>That the Overclothyng of the Tutour and pouer folk be derk and brown of colour; and not staring
ne blaising; and of esy prised, according to their Degree.” (Stow, i. bk. iii. pp. 4-5.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Almshouse, removed from its former place behind the church of St. Michael
Royal, is still in existence at Highgate.</p>

<p>We may pass rapidly through the few remaining small Houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denton’s Hospital</span> is entered as one of them, but it never existed except in
the intention of the Founder, Robert de Denton. He obtained, in 1369, the
Royal license to found a Hospital for distracted priests and others, but could not
carry out his intentions, and instead founded a chantry at the House of St.
Katherine by the Tower.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Charing Cross Hospital</span> I find nothing but a tradition that one of the
Kings, being annoyed by the presence of the patients so near the Court, ordered
their removal to Bethlehem Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael, Crooked Lane.</span> This College was founded by Sir William
Walworth, who united certain Chantries and added lands and certain houses, and so
formed a College for the support of a Master and nine priests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barking College</span> was attached to the Church of All Hallows, Barking.
Richard the First founded and endowed here a Chapel to the Virgin. John, Earl
of Worcester, added a Brotherhood with a Master and Brethren endowed from the
alien Houses of Tooting, Bow, and Okeburn. Richard the Third rebuilt the Chapel
and founded a college with a Dean and six Fellows. It was dissolved by Edward
the Sixth, the buildings pulled down, and the ground converted into a garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holme’s College of St. Paul’s</span> was founded by Roger Holme, Chancellor of
St. Paul’s, in 1395, as a college of seven Priests, whose services were held in the
Chapel of the Holy Ghost. The College buildings stood in the parish of St.
Gregory, south of the Cathedral Precinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lancaster College</span> was founded by Henry the Fourth and the executors of
John of Gaunt in connection with the Cathedral: the College buildings were also in
the Parish of St. Gregory.</p>

<p>Another College in connection with the Cathedral was that of the <span class="smcap">Minor
Canons</span>, founded by Richard the Second. They had houses adjoining the Precinct
and a Common Hall within the Precinct.</p>

<p>The College of <span class="smcap">St. Lawrence Poulteney</span>, in connection with that church,
consisted of a Master or Warden, thirteen priests, clerks, and choristers.</p>

<p>In Dowgate stood a small college of Priests called <span class="smcap">Jesus Commons</span>: Stow says
that it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> “House well furnished with Brass, Pewter, Napery, Plate, etc.,
besides a fair Library well stored with books: all which of old time were given to a
number of priests that should keep Commons there.” Evidently a quiet and peaceful
College, not unlike All Souls, Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. James’ in the Fields</span>, a hospital founded from time immemorial, for leprous
virgins of the City, was suppressed by Henry the Eighth. St. James’s Palace
stands upon its site.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary Rouncevall</span> or <span class="smcap">Runcevall</span>, at Charing Cross, a hospital, suppressed
as an alien House by Henry the Fifth, was refounded as a Brotherhood by Edward
the Fourth, provided with new statutes for a Master, Wardens, Brethren, and Sisters
by Henry the Seventh, and suppressed again by Edward the Sixth. Northumberland
House, with its gardens, used to occupy exactly the Precinct of St. Mary
Rouncevall. It was built, as Northampton House, in the year 1614.</p>

<p>Beside this House was a modest Hermitage, named after <span class="smcap">St. Catherine</span>,
founded by Edward the First (see also Appendix XI.).</p>

<small>FRATERNITIES</small></h3>


<p>We must not forget the Fraternities. There was not, I believe, a single Parish
Church which had not its Fraternity. Except for purposes of war, when all marched
under order of the King, the first attempt at union was the Parish Fraternity.
The Parish Church has always been the natural centre round which gathered the
temporal as well as the spiritual concerns of the Parish. The Fraternity, dedicated
to the Patron Saint of the Parish, was a union of all for the protection of all: the
members maintained those who were sick and old, educated and apprenticed the
orphans, protected the widows, celebrated masses for the dead. They formed
themselves into one family. How, then, do we find so many Fraternities belonging
to separate trades? Two explanations are possible. One, that the parishes became
entirely composed of men practising the same trade, with their families: the other
that a large proportion of men engaged in one trade lived in the parish. In the
former case, the Fraternity of the Parish Church became the Fraternity of one
trade: in the other case it was reasonable that men carrying on the same trade
should live as much together as possible, for convenience, use of tools, acquisition
of raw material, and regulation as to production: that they should break off from
one common parish Fraternity and constitute their own Fraternity for their own
advantage.</p>

<p>Thus we have the Fraternity of St. Anthony, consisting of Pepperers; that of
St. Nicholas, consisting of Parish Clerks; of Corpus Christi consisting of Cloth-workers;
of St. George, consisting of Armourers; of St. John the Baptist, consisting
of Merchant Taylors; and that of St. Mary, consisting of the Drapers. (See
Appendix XII.)</p>

<p>In other words, the Companies did not spring out of the Fraternities: the
union of men working at the same trade grew up slowly: the Fraternity was the
first outward proof that such union had been formed: it consecrated the union.
When the Company was finally formed, it only laid down as definite law what had
been for many years a custom; the Fraternity was in no way touched by the new
Charter; thus, the Religious side of the union went on and flourished until all
such Fraternities were destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>There were, however, other Fraternities. I find, in the fourteenth century,
mention of over a hundred: of these, by far the larger number are the Parish
Church Fraternities. Then there are the Trade Fraternities mentioned above, and
those representing some form of religious fervour by which the Church provided
an outlet for enthusiasts.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Such were the Fraternities of the Holy Cross, of the Light of the Holy Cross,
of the Holy Trinity, of Jesus, of the Holy Ghost, of the Assumption of the Virgin,
of the Resurrection of Christ. Annual services and processions, certain vows of
abstinence and chastity, alms, some kind of outward decoration, distinguished the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Brethren and helped to make life seem fuller of interest, and themselves of more
importance. Meantime, the real importance of the Fraternities in the history of
London is that they first showed the way to common action, and made the
independence, the dignity, and the wealth of trade possible.</p>

<p>A Fraternity of importance was that of Aldersgate, originally a Hospital for
the Poor. It was an Alien Foundation: therefore, on the suppression of all
such Houses by Henry the Fifth, it was given, with the lands, to the Parish of
St. Botolph’s, Aldersgate, and a Fraternity of the Holy Trinity took its place.
This Fraternity had its own Chapel. It endured to the time of Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>Close beside it was the Chapel of another small Religious body called the
Chapel of Mount Calvary without Aldersgate.</p>

<p>Yet a third house outside Aldersgate was the Hospital of the Abbot of
Walden, founded 15 Ed. II.</p>

<p>The Fraternity of St. James, Garlickhithe, was governed by rules which have
been preserved by Stow:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the Worship of God Almighty our Creator, and his Moder Saint Marie, and Allhallows and
Saint James Apostle, a Fraternite is begon of gode Men in the Church of Saint James the Yer of our
Lord 1375, for Amendement of her Lyves, and of her Sowls, and to nourish more Love among the

<p>The care of the sick, and especially of the helpless and incurable, is one of the
first duties recognised by men when they begin to associate. Stow says that the
hospital for leprous women at St. James’s existed from time immemorial. Leprosy
is the most incurable of all diseases; it devours body and mind; it renders the
unhappy victim helpless. The Lazar House, therefore, was very naturally
founded before any other hospital. Those of London already mentioned were St.

year of Edward the Third, four Locks for lepers—viz. one in the Old Kent Road,

<small>AN ANCHORITE’S CELL</small><a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></h3>


<p>“Soon after the present work was begun a strange hole was discovered in the chancel wall, just at
the turn of the apse on the north side. It is about 4 feet high and 20 inches wide. There is no
stonework. A roughly rectangular hole has been broken through the flint wall, and the sides of it
plastered to something like a smooth face. There is no provision for or mark of a door. And it was
difficult to assign any reason for the making of the hole. Yet it was certain that some reason for it had
been. Rough as it is, there is enough care bestowed on its making to show that it was not one of the
openings sometimes left in the walls of buildings for the convenience of bringing things in during their
construction, and blocked up when done with. Besides, it is too small for such a use. It was suggested
that it may have been made to bring in a coffin at some funeral. But it is too small for that also: and it
needs to be shown why men should have broken through the wall to bring in a coffin when it was much
easier to bring it in by a door. Then it was guessed that it might belong to some extinct stove for
warming the church; but neither the position nor anything in the form of the hole seemed likely for that
use. It is too small to have been the entrance to a vestry, though the position is a proper one; and
certainly there must have been a door had that been its purpose. Yet if the hole had ever more than a
temporary use, it must have led to some chamber outside, for the church could not have been used if it
were open to the weather.</p>

<p>Some further light was thrown on the place a few months ago when a coating of modern cement
was stripped off the outside of the wall. Then was found a second hole about the same size as the first,
but cut only part way through the wall. It is plastered inside with clay, and was filled up with flints and
clay. Rather above these holes, and east and west of them respectively, are two smaller ones, such as
may have received the ends of timbers. These also were found stopped with clay. The annexed
illustration explains the work better than any description.</p>

<p>It seems that a little wooden hut has been built at some time against the wall of the church. The
smaller holes give its length from east to west—about eight feet inside—and perhaps also its greatest
height, about six feet. But this last and the width from north to south are uncertain, for there is nothing
to show what was the shape of the roof, and if there were ever any foundations they are not to be found
now. The walls were probably of stud and clay daubing, and the roof thatch.</p>

<p>The place can hardly have been other than an anker’s den. And it must surely have been one of
the least commodious. It is remarkable that so few such have been identified, for the numbers of ankers
in England must at one time have been considerable. There is a good deal about them in the second
volume of the new edition of Mr. Bloxam’s <cite>Gothic Architecture</cite>, and Mr. Bloxam would assign to ankers
most of the habitable chambers attached to churches, over vestries and porches and elsewhere. Very
likely some such were used by ankers of the easier sort: but I think more were occupied by secular clerks
and chaplains, and the anker’s place was a hut built outside against the wall, under the eaves of the church,
as is said in the thirteenth-century <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, which tells us more about ankers than any other book
I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span></p>

<p>A cell was so placed that the anker need not leave it, either for worship or for any other reason.
There was a window opening through which he might join in the worship at the altar, and at times receive
the sacrament. And there was another window or hatch to the outside through which necessaries might
be received and conversation held with visitors or servants. A window or squint is often found from a
chamber over a vestry towards the high altar, and there is sometimes one from a porch chamber: but
being on upper floors they could not well have the other window, so I take most of them not to have been
ankerholds. Though as the degree of strictness varied much and seems for the most part to have been
fixed only by the anker himself, it is possible that some may have been so used. The anker of the
strictest sort was inclusus—permanently shut up in his cell which he entered with the license and blessing of
the bishop. Such an one could scarcely have inhabited an upper chamber. Whether our Bengeo Anker
was inclusus or not is uncertain. The entrance to his cell had no door, but it may have been blocked,
and a squint or loop towards the altar formed the blocking. If it were open a curtain must have been
hung across it, perhaps a black cloth with a white cross like that ordered in the <i>Riwle</i> to be put to the
‘parlour’ window.</p>

<p>The recess in the church wall west of the doorway is the anker’s seat and perhaps his sleeping
place. And his bones may lie below: for it seems to have been a custom for ankers to prepare their
own graves within their cells.”</p>

<small>A DOMINICAN HOUSE</small></h3>


<p>The following Notes are from the <cite>Archæolog. Journal</cite>:—</p>

<p>“The traditions of the Dominican order required that the buildings should be arranged quadrilaterally,
enclosing a plot of ground which formed the cloistral cemetery for the deceased of the community, one side being
occupied by the church; but no fixed rule was adopted for the distribution of the offices. This is apparent from
the plans of several of the English priories founded within the same period of twenty years. At Gloucester,
Bristol, and Stamford, the church formed the north side of the quadrangle, whilst at Norwich and Canterbury it
was on the south, and at Newcastle-on-Tyne it was on the east, being probably regulated by the conveniences of
the localities; and even orientation was not uniformly preserved. The culinary offices at Gloucester were
evidently on the south, whilst at Canterbury they stood on the west.</p>

<p>The early Dominican churches were exceeding simple in arrangement and severe in details. A good
example of them existed at Canterbury where the choir, nave, and two aisles were all included under one long
unbroken roof, and a porch at the west end afforded entrance to the congregation. The church at Gloucester,
consisting of choir, nave, north chapel or transept, and north aisle, being rebuilt about the beginning of the
sixteenth century, departed somewhat from this plan, inasmuch as the chapel was covered with a distinct
transverse roof. It occupied only about three-fourths of the side of the quadrangle, the rest being completed by
monastic buildings. In the church were three altars; the steeple with two bells and the aisle have disappeared.</p>

<p>The rest of the buildings which complete the quadrangle, about 73 feet square, are doubtless the original
structures of the thirteenth century. The dormitory forming the second storey of the south side, with its exterior
stairs, is still perfect, even to the stone partitions of the separate cells. On the ground floor was probably the
refectory. The triplet window in the south gable of the west building is deserving of notice. But the interiors
of all these buildings have been so much changed and adapted for modern requirements, that it is difficult to
ascertain their monastic destinations. The cellaring is extensive, but presents little worthy of remark.”</p>

<small>THE PAPEY</small></h3>


<p>“The Hospital of Le Papey was founded in the year 1442, by Thomas Symminesson, William Cleve,
William Barnaby, and John Stafford, priests in the diocese of London. Symminesson, otherwise written
Symmesson, and Symson, was Rector of All Saints, or All Hallows, on the Wall; Cleve was priest of
the charity of St. John Baptist in the church of St. Mary Aldermary; Barnaby was a chantry priest in the
Cathedral Church of St. Paul; and of Stafford I know no more than that he was a priest in the city
of London. The Hospital was founded for those of their own Order whom age or sickness disabled from
the active performance of the duties of their function.” (Late Rev. Thomas Hugo in <cite>London and Midd.
Archæological Soc.</cite>, vol. v.)</p>

<p>“The name of the Hospital was derived from that of the church which, as we shall see, was
appropriated to it, ordinarily known as St. Augustine’s de Papey.” (<cite>Ibid.</cite> 187.)</p>

<p>“The charter of foundation is as follows. It will supply various particulars of interest which I have
hitherto omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>To all the sons of our Holy Mother the Church to whom and to whose knowledge these letters or
the contents of them shall come, and those whom the writing underneath do touch or shall hereafter
touch, Thomas Symminesson, Parson [vicar or curate, note in margin] of the Parish Church of All Saints
at the Wall of the City of London, together with the Church of St. Augustine Pappey, of the same city, by
ordinary authority, and for true, lawful, and honest causes, joined, annexed, and incorporated to the same
Church of All Saints; and William Cleve, chaplain of the Chantry founded at the altar of St. John
Baptist in the Church of the Blessed Mary of Aldermary Church of London; and William Barnaby, one
of the chaplains of the Chantry in the Cathedral Church of S. Paul in London; and John Stafford,
chaplain of the City of London, send greeting in our Lord everlasting.</p>

<p>Know you all by these presents that the most excellent prince in Christ, and our Lord and Master,
the famous Henry the Sixth, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, of his special grace, sure
knowledge, and mere motion, by advice and assent of this great council, by his letters patents, the tenor
of which is underwritten, to us and to others hath graciously granted and given license for him and his
heirs, as much as in him is, that we three, or any two of us, may begin, make, found, ordain, unite and
establish, in the honour of St. Charity and S. John Evangelist, a certain perpetual Fraternity of
Brotherhood, as well of ourselves and other Chaplains of Chantries and hirelings [conducts, note in
margin] as of other honest men whatsoever, in some place convenient and honest of the said City which
we shall provide for that purpose, for the relief and sustaining of poor priests destroyed [decayed,
in margin] through poverty and detained by diseases, having nothing to live on, but, as well to the great
displeasure of God as the reproach to the Clergy and shame to Holy Church, do miserably beg, to pray
devoutly as well for the healthy state and happy prosperity of our said lord the king and kingdom of
England, and of the nobility and peers, of the Brethren also and Sisters of the Fraternity aforesaid and
also for the souls of all the Faithful Departed, as in the aforesaid royal letters patent, to which and the
contents of the same we refer you, and which in the same here inserted is more fully contained.</p>

<p>Wherefore we, William Cleve, William Barnaby, and John Stafford, the Chaplains aforesaid,—considering
that the premises are good, godly, and meritorious, and firmly minding effectually to perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
and surely to fulfil them, and to found such aforesaid perpetual Fraternity, in the Name of the Holy and
Undivided Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Glorious Virgin Mary, St. Charity,
and St. John Evangelist, in whose honour the aforesaid Fraternity by the King’s license given and granted,
as is said, is founded and ordained [the rights of all and singular persons interested ... in this part given
and conceded], begin and proceed after this order.” (<cite>Ibid.</cite>)</p>

<p>“As so little is known of this ancient church and parish of St. Augustine, I may perhaps be doing
some of my readers a service, by giving them here all the information which is believed to be extant, in
addition to that already included in the present memoir. Stow says that an Earl of Oxford had his inn
within its boundaries, and that the last will of Agnes, Lady Bardolph, anno 1403, was dated from thence
in these words: ‘Hospitio, &amp;c., from the Inn of the Habitation of the Earl of Oxford, in the parish of St.
Augustine’s de Papey, London.’ When or by whom the church was founded I know not. But the names
of the rectors, so far as they are preserved in the episcopal registers, are as follows:</p>

<p>Stephen de Benytone, clerk, presented by the prior and convent of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, xiij Kal.
April (20 March), 1321-2.</p>

<p>Roger Oxecumb, ————?</p>

<p>Adam Long, priest, by the death of R. O., presented by the same, 21 October, 1372.</p>

<p>Adam Nunne, chaplain, by the death of A. L., presented by the same, 19 January, 1395-6.</p>

<p>I presume that he was the last rector. When he died, or otherwise vacated his benefice, I have no
means of determining. But, on his avoidance, the church seems, as already mentioned, to have been too
poor to be worth accepting, and was incorporated accordingly in the manner described. May I suggest,
though with considerable hesitation, that the little graveyard still noticeable in Camomile Street, and once
used as a place of sepulture by the neighbouring but not adjoining parish of St. Martin Outwich, still
marks the site of this ancient church?” (<cite>Ibid.</cite>)</p>

<p>“The brethren of the hospital were selected for their age and infirmities. Poor they necessarily
were on admission, and the slender revenues of the house were barely sufficient to supply the common
needs of human existence. With the exception of their home and the benefactions previously recorded,
I know not of any property belonging to them, save the following:—First, a tenement at Baynard’s Castle,
which is incidentally mentioned in a memorandum in the Cottonian MS., of which a literal copy here
follows:—</p>

<p>
Of the vaute in our ten’t at Bayn<sup>d</sup> castell—<br />
</p>

<p>Be it Remembryd that in o<sup>r</sup> howse at Bayn<sup>d</sup> Castell ys a drawght of the which the entry into the
vaute. ys. vj. fote fro the Reredoce of the Chy’ney beneth in the Kechyn and ij. fote &amp; di’ fro the wall-plate
or ground sell of the est syde of the sayd Kechyn.</p>

<p>Then there were six cottages or chambers in Panyer Alley, in the parish of St. Michael-le-Querne,
belonging to them; and two messuages in the same alley, some particulars of which I have found in the
Patent Roll of the 17th of Elizabeth.” (<cite>Ibid.</cite>)</p>

<p>“The church was pulled down, and on its site ‘one Grey, an apothecary, built a stall and a hayloft.’
At the time that Stow wrote his ‘survey,’ in or about the year 1598, a dwelling-house occupied the
site of the church, and the churchyard was turned into a garden plot. The priests’ house would appear
to have been kept standing, and the names of Mr. Morris, of Essex, Sir Francis Walsingham, and Mr.
Barrett, also of Essex, are mentioned as those of its tenants.</p>

<p>The last record that I can supply of the outraged and pillaged brethren, thus banished from their
ancient home, is that contained in the pension book of Cardinal Pole, where four of them are enumerated
as then, 1556, living and receiving pensions:—Robert Ffoxe, who, it will be remembered, had been the
last master, receiving a yearly pension of lxvj s. viij d.; Richard Bee and George Stroger, the last wardens,
each with a pension of liij s. iiij d.; and John Mardocke, with one of xl s. Two of the six who witnessed
the suppression of their house, Richard Birchall and John Barrett, had, it would appear, died during the
interval.” (<cite>Ibid.</cite>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. Charitable Endowment Generally</span></p>

<p>As for charities and charitable endowments generally, one cannot do better than quote Stow himself:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>
<p>“I myself, in that declining time of charity, have oft seen at the Lord Cromwell’s gate in London
more than two hundred persons served twice every day with bread, meat, and drink sufficient; for he
observed that ancient and charitable custom, as all prelates, noblemen, or men of honour and worship, his
predecessors, had done before him; whereof somewhat to note for example, Venerable Bede writeth,
that prelates of his time having peradventure but wooden churches, had notwithstanding on their board at
their meals one alms dish, into the which was carved some good portion of meat out of every other dish
brought to their table; all which was given to the poor, besides the fragments left, in so much as in a hard
time, a poor prelate wanting victuals, hath caused his alms dish, being silver, to be divided among the
poor, therewith to shift as they could, till God should send them better store.</p>

<p>Such a prelate was Ethelwald, Bishop of Winchester, in the reign of King Edgar, about the year of
Christ 963: he in a great famine sold away all the sacred vessels of his church for to relieve the almost
starved people, saying that there was no reason that the senseless temples of God should abound in riches,
and lively temples of the Holy Ghost to lack it.</p>

<p>Walter de Suffilde, Bishop of Norwich, was of the like mind; about the year 1245, in a time of
great dearth, he sold all his plate, and distributed it to the poor every pennyworth.</p>

<p>Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, about the year 1093, besides the daily fragments of
his house, gave every Friday and Sunday, unto every beggar that came to his gate, a loaf of bread sufficient
for that day, and there were usually, every such alms day, in time of dearth, to the number of five
thousand, and otherwise four thousand, at the least; more, he used every great festival day to give one
hundred and fifty pence to so many poor people, to send daily meat, bread and drink, to such as by age
or sickness were not able to fetch his alms, and to send meat, money, and apparel to such as he thought
needed it.</p>

<p>I read, in 1171, that Henry II., after his return into England, did penance for the slaughter of
Thomas Becket, of whom (a sore dearth increasing) ten thousand persons, from the first of April, till new
corn was inned, were daily fed and sustained.</p>

<p>More, I find recorded, that in the year 1256, the 20th of Henry III., William de Haverhall, the King’s
treasurer, was commanded, that upon the day of the Circumcision of our Lord, six thousand poor people
should be fed at Westminster, for the state of the king, queen, and their children. The like commandment
the said King Henry gave to Hugh Gifford and William Browne, that upon Friday next after the
Epiphany, they should cause to be fed in the great hall at Windsore, at a good fire, all the poor and needy
children that could be found, and the king’s children being weighed and measured, their weight and
measure to be distributed for their good estates. These few examples for charity of kings may suffice.</p>

<p>I read, in the reign of Edward III., that Richard de Berie, Bishop of Durham, did weekly bestow
for the relief of the poor eight quarters of wheat made into bread, besides his alms dish, fragments of
his house, and great sums of money given to the poor when he journeyed. And that these alms dishes
were as well used at the tables of noblemen as of the prelates, one note may suffice in this place.</p>

<p>I read, in the year 1452, that Richard, Duke of York, then claiming the crown, the Lord Rivers
should have passed the sea about the King’s business, but staying at Plimmoth till his money was spent, and
then sending for more, the Duke of Sommerset sent him the image of St. George in silver and gold, to be
sold, with the alms dish of the Duke of Glocester, which was also of great price, for coin had they none.</p>

<p>To end of orders and customs in this city, also of great families kept by honourable persons thither
repairing, and of charitable alms of old times given, I say, for conclusion, that all noble persons, and other
of honour and worship, in former times lodging in this city, or liberties thereof, did without grudging bear
their parts in charges with the citizens, according to their estimated estates, as I have before said, and
could prove by examples; but let men call to mind Sir Thomas Cromwell, then Lord Privy seal, and vicar-general,
lying in the city of London; he bare his charges to the great muster there in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1539; he sent
his men in great number to the miles end, and after them their armour in cars, with their coats of white
cloth, the arms of this city; to wit, a red cross, and a sword, on the breast and back; which armour and
coats they wear amongst the citizens, without any difference, and marched through the city to Westminster.”</p>

<p>The following additions are from the list compiled by Stow; a few of the foundations have been
already considered in the chapters of the Religious Houses:—</p>

<p>It will be observed that these endowments number eleven founded during the fourteenth century,
twenty-three founded during the fifteenth, and thirty-two founded in the sixteenth century. Attention
has already been called to the decay of bequests for charities and masses for the soul, ‘mind-days,’ and
gifts to friars and religious persons during the fifteenth century; it is interesting to note how, while the old
fashion of bequest is decaying, the new fashion is advancing.</p>

<p>“The citizens of London, time out of mind, founded an hospital of St. James in the fields for
leprous women of their city.</p>

<p>In the year 1197, Walter Brune, a citizen of London, and Rosia, his wife, founded the hospital of
Our Lady, called Domus Dei, or St. Marie Spittle.</p>

<p>In the year 1247, Simon Fitzmary, one of the sheriffs of London, founded the hospital of St.
Mary called Bethlem, also without Bishopsgate.</p>

<p>In the year 1283, Henry Wallis, then mayor, built the Tun upon Cornhill, to be a prison for nightwalkers,
and a market-house called the Stocks, both for fish and flesh, standing in the midst of the city.
He also built divers houses on the west and north side of Paule’s churchyard; the profits of all which
buildings are to the maintenance of London Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

<p>In the year 1332, William Elsing, mercer of London, founded Elsing Spittle within Cripplegate
for an hundred poor blind men.</p>

<p>Sir John Poultney, draper, four times mayor, in 1337 built a fair chapel in Paule’s church, wherein
he was buried. He founded a college in the parish church of St. Laurence, called Poultney: he built
the parish church called Little Allhallowes, in Thames Street; the Carmelite friars church in Coventry:
he gave relief to prisoners in Newgate and in the Fleet, and ten shillings a year to St. Giles’ Hospital by
Oldborne for ever, and other legacies long to rehearse.</p>

<p>John Stodie, vintner, mayor 1358, gave to the vintners all the quadrant wherein the Vintners’ hall
now standeth, with all the tenements round about, from Stodies Lane, wherein is founded thirteen alms
houses for so many poor people, &amp;c.</p>

<p>John Lofken, fishmonger, four times mayor, 1367, built an hospital called Magdalen’s, in Kingston
upon Thames; gave thereunto nine tenements, ten shops, one mill, one hundred and twenty-five
acres of land, ten acres of meadow, one hundred and twenty acres of pasture; more, in London, he
built the fair parish church of St. Michael in Crooked Lane, and was there buried.</p>

<p>John Barnes, mayor 1371, gave a chest with three locks, and one thousand marks therein, to be
lent to young men upon sufficient pawn, and for the use thereof, to say <i lang="la">de profundis</i>, or <i lang="la">Pater noster</i>,
and no more: he also was a great builder of St. Thomas Apostle’s parish church, as appeareth by his
arms there, both in stone and glass.</p>

<p>This Sir Robert Knoles, thus worthily infranchised a citizen, founded a college with an hospital
at Pontefract: he also built the great stone bridge at Rochester, over the river of Medway, &amp;c.</p>

<p>John Churchman, grocer, one of the sheriffs, 1386, for the quiet of merchants, built a certain house
upon Wool Wharf, in Tower ward, to serve for tronage or weighing of wools, and for the customer, comptroller,
clerks, and other officers to sit, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adam Bamme, goldsmith, mayor 1391, in a great dearth, procured corn from parts beyond the
seas, to be brought hither in such abundance as sufficed to serve the city, and the countries near adjoining;
to the furtherance of which good work he took out of the orphans’ chest in the Guildhall two thousand
marks to buy the said corn, and each alderman laid out twenty pounds to the like purpose.</p>

<p>Thomas Knoles, grocer, mayor 1400, with his brethren the aldermen, began to new build the
Guildhall in London, and instead of an old little cottage in Aldermanberie Street, made a fair and goodly

discharge of poor prisoners in the Hole, or two penny wards in the two compters in London, in equal
portions to each compter, so that the prisoners exceed not the sum of twenty-six shillings and eight pence
for every one prisoner at any one time.</p>

<p>Thus much for famous citizens have I noted their charitable actions, for the most part done by them
in their lifetime. The residue left in trust to their executors, I have known some of them hardly (or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
never) performed; wherefore I wish men to make their own hands their executors, and their eyes their
overseers, not forgetting the old proverb:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Women be forgetfull, children be unkind,</div>
   <div class="verse">Executors be covetous, and take what they find.</div>
   <div class="verse">If any body aske where the dead’s goods became,</div>
   <div class="verse">They answere, So God me help, and holy dame, he died a poore man.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One worthy citizen merchant-taylor, having many years considered this proverb foregoing, hath
therefore established to twelve poor aged men, merchant-taylors, six pounds two shillings to each yearly
for ever. He hath also given them gowns of good broad cloth, lined thoroughly with bays, and are to
receive every three years’ end the like new gowns for ever.</p>

<p>And now of some women, citizens’ wives, deserving memory, for example to posterity shall be noted.</p>

<p>Dame Agnes Foster, widow, sometime wife to Stephen Foster, fishmonger, mayor 1455, having
enlarged the prison of Ludgate in 1463, procured in a common council of this city, certain articles to be
established for the ease, comfort, and relief of poor prisoners there, as in the chapter of gates I have
set down.</p>

<p>Avice Gibson, wife unto Nicholas Gibson, grocer, one of the sheriffs 1539, by license of her
husband, founded a free school at Radclyffe, near unto London, appointing to the same, for the
instruction of sixty poor men’s children, a schoolmaster and usher with fifty pounds; she also built alms
houses for fourteen poor aged persons, each of them to receive quarterly six shillings and eight pence the
piece for ever; the government of which free school and alms houses she left in confidence to the
Coopers in London.</p>

<p>Margaret Danne, widow to William Danne, ironmonger, one of the sheriffs of London, gave by her
testament to the ironmongers, two thousand pounds, to be lent to young men of that company, paying
after the rate of five pounds in the year for every hundred; which one hundred pounds so rising yearly
to be employed on charitable actions as she then appointed, but not performed in more than thirty,
years after.</p>

<p>Dame Mary Ramsey, wife to Sir Thomas Ramsey, mayor about the year 1577, being seised of lands
in fee simple of her inheritance to the yearly value of two hundred and forty-three pounds, by his consent
gave the same to Christ’s Hospital in London towards the relief of poor Children there.”</p>

It is interesting to note the places mentioned in this document. They are the Old Temple (in Holborn,
at the N.E. corner of Chancery Lane); Jews’ Street, <i>i.e.</i> the old Jewry; St. Olave’s Jewry; Market Street
(Cheapside); Fish Street; St. Margaret’s Church; St. Peter’s, Cornhill; Chepe; the Flete; Aldermanberie;
St. Clement’s; and St. Paul’s.

The measurements of the land show that it was divided up for the houses and their gardens very much as
suburban land is now parcelled out; the lots are generally 30 feet wide by 100 feet long, which is about the
space now occupied by a small suburban house. The rent of such a piece of ground was about 2s.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
